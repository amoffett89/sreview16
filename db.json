Regardless of this heat, my grandfather stood peacefully beside my house dressed in his go-to outfit: a suit and tie. He was a gentleman; poised, yet brittle, and smelt of plants, spices, and smoke. With his hands clasped tightly together behind his back, and his toes as his single source of balance, he bent over to take a peek at our magnificent magenta roses.\n\nHe hovered over them and admired their aromas, just like we all do over a freshly baked batch of cookies. Then he pulled away, and with a crooked smile, pointed to a particular rose. I struggled to stretch my body far enough to view this unique flower, but once I recognized what made it oh-so “special,” I instantly folded back to the ground like an accordion.\n \nThere was a family of five bees on this one rose, and I thought one was going to go up my nose!  My grandfather thought differently. He told me, “If all of these bees are fighting over this single rose, imagine how exceptional its fragrance must be.” He seemed crazy, but after the monsters flew away, we both took a waft, and he was right. This freshly blossomed rose had an aroma that was sweeter and more elegant than any flower I’d ever smelled before; its perfume was as thick and rich as red velvet, and lingered within my senses even after I walked away. I’ll never forget it’s tantalizing fragrance.\n\nMy grandfather mastered the art of smelling roses. He shared tips with me like, “The darker a rose’s color or the more petals it has, the more fragrant the scent!”  But his appreciation for roses was only a fraction of his overall appreciation for life. He possessed an innate empathetic nature by consistently remaining present and assuring the people surrounding him that they mattered. Even as the sole breadwinner for a household of fifteen, he prioritized the time he spent with family, and noticed that the mundane moments in life are what made it so worthwhile. He emphasized, “Make time to share memorable experiences with others. Savor everything and everyone you’re blessed with. Be present.”\n\nAnd as I grew older, he told me, “You have to work hard and make things happen, but also, you need to take a step back and let things happen.” Our natural world’s beauty is temporary, our relationships with our friends and family are temporary; therefore, we should intend to enjoy whatever time we have. My grandfather deliberately lived by the expression, “to stop and smell the roses.”\n\nWhen he died, it felt as though every rose on Earth was ripped out of the ground. My family sensed the flower’s piercing thorns, rather than its smooth petals. It felt as though he took parts of my identity with him. I don’t why I recognized the subtle backgrounds in my life and their positive impacts after they disappeared. During the wintertime, I missed the fragrance of roses welcoming me into my household, and during family get-togethers, I missed the presence of my grandfather. Whenever he was near, he’d radiate warmth, making sure I feel at home. He made my family complete. I hated how our roses continued to bloom even though he was no longer here, but as time rolled by, the endless life cycle of a rose, through its birth and death, brought me relief. I gained reassurance once I realized that as long as the scent of my grandfather’s adored roses carries on, so will he.\n \nIt’s been five years since he’s passed, and now every time I see a luscious rose in my front yard, I take a moment to absorb its bittersweet qualities. His scent remains with them. It feels like he’s still here; still in his suit and tie, teaching me about the everyday beauties of the world. I believe that everyone should stop and smell the roses, because their scent is the most comforting scent in the world. \n","source":"SmellsLikeHome.md","raw":"---\ntitle: Smells Like Home\nauthor: Aisha Bilal\nlayout: article\nheaderimage: \naccenttext: Our natural world’s beauty is temporary, our relationships with our friends and family are temporary; therefore, we should intend to enjoy whatever time we have.\n---\nI strolled onto my front porch in a light cotton dress, and sensed the pounding hot fists of summer onto my body.

It was August 20, 2002, one of my last days of that year’s summer camp, when my father picked me up in our new family hauler — a dark red Honda CR-V that he and my mother affectionately named Rhonda. My first love. Rhonda the Honda. To say Rhonda was pretty would have to be said with strange facial contortions; it would be said through squinted eyes and a voice a few octaves higher than usual, usually accompanied by a shrug or six. But she was a Honda and that meant she was cheap and very reliable, something perfect for our little middle class family. She was a replacement for my mother’s fourteen-year-old Honda Civic, called Wanda the Honda, oddly enough. The only memory I had of Wanda was a huge spider crushed in one of the doors that literally mentally scarred me for life. No wonder I didn’t mind seeing Wanda go. Plus, now we had Rhonda. Rhonda would shoulder our burdens on long trips to Cooperstown, Boston, or even just the sandy shores of Stone Harbor.\n\nThe first car I fell in love with was my dad’s old Ford Escort station wagon he named Fred. Fred died on a hot summer day in 2006 at the Cherry Hill Mall parking lot. For some reason, I had to choke back tears while staring out of Rhonda’s back hatch as we drove away with a heat mirage rising up and enveloping Fred’s dark blue exterior. My parents spoke in hushed, angry tones in the front seats about the next thing to do; my father had to drive to a train station every day and my mother to her job at a local newspaper twenty minutes from home, so they needed two cars. I pressed my face up against Rhonda’s rear seat backs and watched as Fred grew smaller and smaller, letting the khaki-colored fabric imprint my skin with square shapes. At least we still had her. Her maroon exterior sparkled in the late August sun and her khaki-colored interior was firm yet warm; like a mother that pushes hard but is always there when times get tough.\n\nOwnership of Rhonda moved from my mother to my father when Fred died and my mother had bought a slightly used dark gray Toyota Corolla she named Gaston, after a now former Philadelphia Flyers goalie. Rhonda was getting up there in years now, but she showed no signs of malfunction. She was a Honda through and through and was built to withstand anything. She lived through hurricanes, ridiculous blizzards, and so much more. She had dings, scratches, cracks, and bad brakes, but she was ours.\n\nRhonda was special to me because of how long she was in my life. We got her when I was six and I sold her when I was twenty. That’s fourteen years of my life, seventy fucking percent of it, that I spent with Rhonda. She was there for the best and the worst parts of my life, from weddings to funerals and everything in between. She had taken me on dates and coddled me after breakups. She was a constant. I was sixteen when I learned to drive, and I did it in Rhonda. I was eighteen when she officially became mine, after my father bought a brand new Volkswagen hatchback for himself. I got a couple of clip-on window American flags to put on the rear windows and Rhonda became The Iron Patriot, going by Rhonda only to her close friends and family.\n\nShe had her quirks and that was part of the reason why she was so special to me. One such quirk was that the front two seat belts would only properly clasp if hit with the passenger’s wrist from a very specific angle. Another was that the rear passenger doors didn’t lock with the universal locking mechanism on the driver’s side, but rather had to be operated manually. That was what caused me to be locked out of the car in the middle of nowhere with no phone, shirt, or shoes for an hour and a half before I shattered a window, unlocked the door, and embarrassingly drove home.\n\nThe Iron Patriot accompanied me alone for roughly twenty-five thousand miles. She made appearances in different states, drove up and back to my best friend’s house in Freehold several times, and had many times undergone the stereotypical teenage rite of passage — backseat summer car sex. The Iron Patriot was especially important in the formation of a long distance relationship. I had met a girl staying in Gladwyne, Pennsylvania for a few weeks and made the thirty-five-or-so-minute journey there and back a dozen or more times in those few weeks. The young woman and I laughed, kissed, fucked, and loved in The Iron Patriot. Bathed in her headlights, I tearfully bid this young woman goodbye for a few months before I would fly to her home state to visit her, leaving The Iron Patriot alone for five days to relax under a low autumn sun. The Iron Patriot, through all of this life experience, saw it all. They saw objects or places can sometimes become haunted if they see enough emotional anguish or energy, so I’d say that there’s a good shot that today some poor kid has a haunted, fourteen-year-old CR-V.\n\nNaturally, the aforementioned long distance relationship came to a close. It was late one Sunday night (or Monday morning, depending on your point of view) in early January. I was sitting in my car after a late, lone viewing of Leonardo DiCaprio’s Oscar-winning performance in *The Revenant.* My long term, long distance relationship was about to end. I knew it, and she knew it. We’d hardly spoken for six days. I decided that it was a good time to reach out and say “hey,” while sitting alone in my car at 1:30 in the morning.\n\n*Ring ring.* Nothing. Listening to the dial tone, I stared at the front of the theater through The Iron Patriot’s frost-covered windshield.\n\n*Ring ring.* Still nothing. Light snow had began to fall, reflecting color in all directions as it glided softly down in front of the theater’s blue neon letters.\n\n*Ring ri—* “Hello?” her voice sounded tired.\n\n“Hey,” I said back.\n\n“What’s up?”\n\n“I, uh, just got out of a movie. Thought I’d see what’s up.”\n\n“Thought you’d see what’s up, huh?”\n\n“Yep.”\n\n“Well, I just got into bed. I’ll talk to you later.”\n\n“Oh, uh…okay. Bye. I love y—” the line was dead.\n\nI threw my phone into the back seat and punched the ceiling of my poor Rhonda as hard as I could, making a slight dent. She was Rhonda to me that night, after an extremely intimate and emotional experience she and I shared together that I somehow coped with alone.\n\nI sat in the lot for a while, caressing my now-red knuckles and enjoying the silence and the snow. I watched the last of the cars pull out of the lot as a thin, powdery white built on Rhonda’s windshield wipers. I watched cracks in the asphalt fill up while the rest of the tarmac sat speckled and frozen like the crusted surface of an icy sea. I watched the neon blue letters spelling CARMIKE flicker and turn off as the snow piled softly on top of them. When it reached half an inch, I decided I’d stop wallowing in self-pity and go home. The world was cold, but life went on.\n\nThe next few months were weird. I was in school, sure, and working, but I got it in my head that I should start looking for a different car. Not a new one, I had an idea of what I wanted (preferably late-‘90s or early 2000s Hondas), but a different car. I knew I was going to be getting rid of The Iron Patriot. A few times I stopped and told myself I’d drive her until she died and I was *forced* to get rid of her, but the desire to get something else always won out. My parents were really on the side of me getting a new car too; they’d worried about their only child driving a fourteen-year-old crossover whose steering wheel shook past fifty miles an hour up and down the highway seven days a week all over and through the dips and bends of New Jersey. I can’t say that I blame them looking back.\n\nIn late May of last year, Honda’s newly redesigned Civic coupes went on sale. One of the colors was an obnoxious “energy green pearl” as deemed by Honda, and I was hooked. I was willing to get rid of my beloved Patriot for this green…thing. A Friday in early June my father accompanied me to a nearby Honda dealership where I would seal the deal. I was getting rid of Rhonda. I test drove this green Civic and was happy enough with it. It was fast (although fast to me after driving The Iron Patriot for three years could have been a wheelchair on ice), nimble, and quiet. I was sold. It would help me build credit. It was much better on gas, much more attractive, and way safer. What could go wrong? What was wrong with this plan? There was nary a doubt in my mind that this was the right call and so I decided to sell The Iron Patriot and use that money as a downpayment on this new Civic I had started to call Maxine.\n\nAbout three quarters of the way through the dealings, I was hit with incredible remorse. I was actually going to have to leave my Rhonda behind. My back was to the dealership’s outer windows where she sat in the rain, staring in at me. I made the mistake of turning around to look at her and started to sob. Not a quiet, remorseful sob, but rather a loud and ugly one. That car was the only thing besides my parents to be constant in my life for seventy percent of it. I sobbed harder and harder and still she sat staring at me, rain collecting on her windshield and hood. Her big, triangular headlights gleamed brightly at me as they became covered in rain. It looked like she was crying too. I couldn’t believe how attached I was to her; I never thought the day would come when I would actually have to get rid of my Rhonda. My father tried consoling me but it was no real use. I was a wreck. He was emotional too, but not making a scene the way I was.\n\nI had left the table to go clean myself up in the bathroom where a kind old mechanic helped to console me. I was rubbing my eyes at the sink and washing my face with cold water when I felt a large hand pat me on the shoulder.\n\n“You okay, son?” he asked me.\n\n“Y-Yeah,” I managed to stammer out. “I’m selling my first car. She’s been in my life for fourteen years.”\n\n“Oh,” he looked at me with soft compassion and then smiled faintly. “I’ll take care of her for you.”\n\nI looked at him and tried to muster up some positive emotion but couldn’t. He smiled again, looked down, and walked out.\n\nWhile startlingly kind for a stranger, his words only made me sob harder. I eventually cleaned myself up and walked back to our negotiating table, where Rhonda’s plates sat in the middle, warped and weathered, a startling contrast. I looked out the window to where she was parked and she was gone. My father had asked the people at the dealership to pull her away before we left so I wouldn’t have to drive past her, wet and alone, in my brand new spotless Civic that didn’t have issues with its locks or seat belts or its steering wheel shaking. It was very considerate and I still think it’s one of the nicest things anyone has ever done for me.\n\nI left the dealership that day in much better shape than I was in a few paragraphs ago, still sad but beguiled at how well equipped even base model cars are these days. My Civic, Maxine, is great. She drives wonderfully, is fun around corners, has a nice little growl to her, and currently does 36.1 miles per gallon, giving me approximately four hundred and thirty five miles to a tank. She’s pretty to look at and I always get compliments on her color, but she isn’t the CR-V. Not a day goes by where I don’t think of my Iron Patriot, Rhonda, the car that picked me up from summer camp at age six, that I grew up in, that was my own personal love shack from ages seventeen to twenty, that was simultaneously one of my closest friends and best nurturing figures. What I experience on a daily basis because of Rhonda is an emotion known on this world as “regret.” Her license plates hang next to my bed, warped and weathered, a reminder of the old days, as if I could ever forget.\n\nEveryone remembers their first love.\n","source":"Rhonda.md","raw":"---\ntitle: Rhonda\nauthor: Sam Lyons\nlayout: article\nheaderimage: img/header-rhonda.jpg\naccentimage: img/accent-image-rhonda.jpg\n---\nIn life, every American remembers two things — their first car and their first love.

It was August 20, 2002, one of my last days of that year’s summer camp, when my father picked me up in our new family hauler — a dark red Honda CR-V that he and my mother affectionately named Rhonda. My first love. Rhonda the Honda. To say Rhonda was pretty would have to be said with strange facial contortions; it would be said through squinted eyes and a voice a few octaves higher than usual, usually accompanied by a shrug or six. But she was a Honda and that meant she was cheap and very reliable, something perfect for our little middle class family. She was a replacement for my mother’s fourteen-year-old Honda Civic, called Wanda the Honda, oddly enough. The only memory I had of Wanda was a huge spider crushed in one of the doors that literally mentally scarred me for life. No wonder I didn’t mind seeing Wanda go. Plus, now we had Rhonda. Rhonda would shoulder our burdens on long trips to Cooperstown, Boston, or even just the sandy shores of Stone Harbor.</p>\n<p>The first car I fell in love with was my dad’s old Ford Escort station wagon he named Fred. Fred died on a hot summer day in 2006 at the Cherry Hill Mall parking lot. For some reason, I had to choke back tears while staring out of Rhonda’s back hatch as we drove away with a heat mirage rising up and enveloping Fred’s dark blue exterior. My parents spoke in hushed, angry tones in the front seats about the next thing to do; my father had to drive to a train station every day and my mother to her job at a local newspaper twenty minutes from home, so they needed two cars. I pressed my face up against Rhonda’s rear seat backs and watched as Fred grew smaller and smaller, letting the khaki-colored fabric imprint my skin with square shapes. At least we still had her. Her maroon exterior sparkled in the late August sun and her khaki-colored interior was firm yet warm; like a mother that pushes hard but is always there when times get tough.</p>\n<p>Ownership of Rhonda moved from my mother to my father when Fred died and my mother had bought a slightly used dark gray Toyota Corolla she named Gaston, after a now former Philadelphia Flyers goalie. Rhonda was getting up there in years now, but she showed no signs of malfunction. She was a Honda through and through and was built to withstand anything. She lived through hurricanes, ridiculous blizzards, and so much more. She had dings, scratches, cracks, and bad brakes, but she was ours.</p>\n<p>Rhonda was special to me because of how long she was in my life. We got her when I was six and I sold her when I was twenty. That’s fourteen years of my life, seventy fucking percent of it, that I spent with Rhonda. She was there for the best and the worst parts of my life, from weddings to funerals and everything in between. She had taken me on dates and coddled me after breakups. She was a constant. I was sixteen when I learned to drive, and I did it in Rhonda. I was eighteen when she officially became mine, after my father bought a brand new Volkswagen hatchback for himself. I got a couple of clip-on window American flags to put on the rear windows and Rhonda became The Iron Patriot, going by Rhonda only to her close friends and family.</p>\n<p>She had her quirks and that was part of the reason why she was so special to me. One such quirk was that the front two seat belts would only properly clasp if hit with the passenger’s wrist from a very specific angle. Another was that the rear passenger doors didn’t lock with the universal locking mechanism on the driver’s side, but rather had to be operated manually. That was what caused me to be locked out of the car in the middle of nowhere with no phone, shirt, or shoes for an hour and a half before I shattered a window, unlocked the door, and embarrassingly drove home.</p>\n<p>The Iron Patriot accompanied me alone for roughly twenty-five thousand miles. She made appearances in different states, drove up and back to my best friend’s house in Freehold several times, and had many times undergone the stereotypical teenage rite of passage — backseat summer car sex. The Iron Patriot was especially important in the formation of a long distance relationship. I had met a girl staying in Gladwyne, Pennsylvania for a few weeks and made the thirty-five-or-so-minute journey there and back a dozen or more times in those few weeks. The young woman and I laughed, kissed, fucked, and loved in The Iron Patriot. Bathed in her headlights, I tearfully bid this young woman goodbye for a few months before I would fly to her home state to visit her, leaving The Iron Patriot alone for five days to relax under a low autumn sun. The Iron Patriot, through all of this life experience, saw it all. They saw objects or places can sometimes become haunted if they see enough emotional anguish or energy, so I’d say that there’s a good shot that today some poor kid has a haunted, fourteen-year-old CR-V.</p>\n<p>Naturally, the aforementioned long distance relationship came to a close. It was late one Sunday night (or Monday morning, depending on your point of view) in early January. I was sitting in my car after a late, lone viewing of Leonardo DiCaprio’s Oscar-winning performance in <em>The Revenant.</em> My long term, long distance relationship was about to end. I knew it, and she knew it. We’d hardly spoken for six days. I decided that it was a good time to reach out and say “hey,” while sitting alone in my car at 1:30 in the morning.</p>\n<p><em>Ring ring.</em> Nothing. Listening to the dial tone, I stared at the front of the theater through The Iron Patriot’s frost-covered windshield.</p>\n<p><em>Ring ring.</em> Still nothing. Light snow had began to fall, reflecting color in all directions as it glided softly down in front of the theater’s blue neon letters.</p>\n<p><em>Ring ri—</em> “Hello?” her voice sounded tired.</p>\n<p>“Hey,” I said back.</p>\n<p>“What’s up?”</p>\n<p>“I, uh, just got out of a movie. Thought I’d see what’s up.”</p>\n<p>“Thought you’d see what’s up, huh?”</p>\n<p>“Yep.”</p>\n<p>“Well, I just got into bed. I’ll talk to you later.”</p>\n<p>“Oh, uh…okay. Bye. I love y—” the line was dead.</p>\n<p>I threw my phone into the back seat and punched the ceiling of my poor Rhonda as hard as I could, making a slight dent. She was Rhonda to me that night, after an extremely intimate and emotional experience she and I shared together that I somehow coped with alone.</p>\n<p>I sat in the lot for a while, caressing my now-red knuckles and enjoying the silence and the snow. I watched the last of the cars pull out of the lot as a thin, powdery white built on Rhonda’s windshield wipers. I watched cracks in the asphalt fill up while the rest of the tarmac sat speckled and frozen like the crusted surface of an icy sea. I watched the neon blue letters spelling CARMIKE flicker and turn off as the snow piled softly on top of them. When it reached half an inch, I decided I’d stop wallowing in self-pity and go home. The world was cold, but life went on.</p>\n<p>The next few months were weird. I was in school, sure, and working, but I got it in my head that I should start looking for a different car. Not a new one, I had an idea of what I wanted (preferably late-‘90s or early 2000s Hondas), but a different car. I knew I was going to be getting rid of The Iron Patriot. A few times I stopped and told myself I’d drive her until she died and I was <em>forced</em> to get rid of her, but the desire to get something else always won out. My parents were really on the side of me getting a new car too; they’d worried about their only child driving a fourteen-year-old crossover whose steering wheel shook past fifty miles an hour up and down the highway seven days a week all over and through the dips and bends of New Jersey. I can’t say that I blame them looking back.</p>\n<p>In late May of last year, Honda’s newly redesigned Civic coupes went on sale. One of the colors was an obnoxious “energy green pearl” as deemed by Honda, and I was hooked. I was willing to get rid of my beloved Patriot for this green…thing. A Friday in early June my father accompanied me to a nearby Honda dealership where I would seal the deal. I was getting rid of Rhonda. I test drove this green Civic and was happy enough with it. It was fast (although fast to me after driving The Iron Patriot for three years could have been a wheelchair on ice), nimble, and quiet. I was sold. It would help me build credit. It was much better on gas, much more attractive, and way safer. What could go wrong? What was wrong with this plan? There was nary a doubt in my mind that this was the right call and so I decided to sell The Iron Patriot and use that money as a downpayment on this new Civic I had started to call Maxine.</p>\n<p>About three quarters of the way through the dealings, I was hit with incredible remorse. I was actually going to have to leave my Rhonda behind. My back was to the dealership’s outer windows where she sat in the rain, staring in at me. I made the mistake of turning around to look at her and started to sob. Not a quiet, remorseful sob, but rather a loud and ugly one. That car was the only thing besides my parents to be constant in my life for seventy percent of it. I sobbed harder and harder and still she sat staring at me, rain collecting on her windshield and hood. Her big, triangular headlights gleamed brightly at me as they became covered in rain. It looked like she was crying too. I couldn’t believe how attached I was to her; I never thought the day would come when I would actually have to get rid of my Rhonda. My father tried consoling me but it was no real use. I was a wreck. He was emotional too, but not making a scene the way I was.</p>\n<p>I had left the table to go clean myself up in the bathroom where a kind old mechanic helped to console me. I was rubbing my eyes at the sink and washing my face with cold water when I felt a large hand pat me on the shoulder.</p>\n<p>“You okay, son?” he asked me.</p>\n<p>“Y-Yeah,” I managed to stammer out. “I’m selling my first car. She’s been in my life for fourteen years.”</p>\n<p>“Oh,” he looked at me with soft compassion and then smiled faintly. “I’ll take care of her for you.”</p>\n<p>I looked at him and tried to muster up some positive emotion but couldn’t. He smiled again, looked down, and walked out.</p>\n<p>While startlingly kind for a stranger, his words only made me sob harder. I eventually cleaned myself up and walked back to our negotiating table, where Rhonda’s plates sat in the middle, warped and weathered, a startling contrast. I looked out the window to where she was parked and she was gone. My father had asked the people at the dealership to pull her away before we left so I wouldn’t have to drive past her, wet and alone, in my brand new spotless Civic that didn’t have issues with its locks or seat belts or its steering wheel shaking. It was very considerate and I still think it’s one of the nicest things anyone has ever done for me.</p>\n<p>I left the dealership that day in much better shape than I was in a few paragraphs ago, still sad but beguiled at how well equipped even base model cars are these days. My Civic, Maxine, is great. She drives wonderfully, is fun around corners, has a nice little growl to her, and currently does 36.1 miles per gallon, giving me approximately four hundred and thirty five miles to a tank. She’s pretty to look at and I always get compliments on her color, but she isn’t the CR-V.

Everytime I see you, you’re busy judging those who are different from yourself. You raise yourself up by forcing others beneath your feet. Prejudice, I will get straight to the point: I don’t like you. In fact, I hate you with a passion. You’re the root of all forms of discrimination. You make weapons out of words and more than once aimed your sword at me. I try to fight back but your words do sting.\n\nPrejudice, do you remember the time when I started playing tennis? You told me that I will lose my femininity by gaining unpleasant muscles and ugly tan lines. You said that sports are not meant for girls because of the risk of injuries. In your opinion, girls should not overexert themselves and stick to easier pastimes. You told me to quit but I refused to listen. Prejudice, I am glad that I chose tennis over you. Although I will acknowledge that tan lines are undesirable because of personal aesthetics, I do not detest them as you want me to. I embrace them because they are the proof of my hard work. I refuse to fulfill your expectations; also, I wouldn’t call my muscles unpleasant. I’m actually proud of them along with the injuries I have sustained and I do not understand why you think I would become less feminine by playing tennis. It’s one of the most graceful and mesmerizing sports out there. Prejudice, you also told me that I would not succeed in tennis because I look weak and small and that no one would take me seriously. I beg to differ as the ex-captain of my highschool team.\n\nYou make me angry, Prejudice. Not only do you belittle me as an athlete because I’m a female, my appearance seems to be of vital importance to you, though I don’t understand why you are concerned with my appearance. I cannot recall how it affects you in any way. If you happen to see me in a dress and heels with makeup on, you tell your friends that I’m trying too hard. If you see me bareface in comfortable clothes, you say that I’m not trying hard enough. What exactly do you want from me then? I don’t dress for you to criticize. I dress for my own satisfaction, not yours. I know that I cannot compare to the picture perfect beauties in your magazines, but let me tell you a little secret: magazine pictures are enhanced with digital software.\n\nMy choice in clothing is not the only aspect of my appearance that you judge. Prejudice, you often have ridiculous expectations and make assumptions about me because of my race. I cannot count how many times you have asked me, “Are you Chinese?” or try to convince me that Japan and China are one and the same. For your information, Japan and China are two different countries with a historically bloody relationship. You automatically think that academics comes naturally to everyone in my race. You wouldn’t know how much school stresses me out and how much effort I put into studying. You’re also always shocked about my perfect English. I don’t know why you expect my English to be poor because I’m not a foreigner; I grew up in New Jersey.\n\nPrejudice, at least when you stand alongside strangers, I have different means of releasing my frustration and anger. It’s much more difficult for me when you stand alongside the people I love, because I don’t know how to respond when you tempt the people precious to me into degrading strangers standing across the street. How do I respond when someone I love points out a tired looking man in dirty clothes and comments that the man is probably on drugs? This is all your fault, Prejudice. You corrupted their minds and I blame you for it. \n\nIt’s also strange when I feel your presence at family parties that you’re not welcome to. I rarely invite my friends to these parties because you make them uncomfortable with your presence. Eating habits, clothing choices, height, size, facial structure, and language are only a small portion of your judging criteria. You manipulate the people around me into consenting with your views and they are at your mercy. You’re the whispered insults and the crude jokes made about my friends’ weight; to which you expect me to laugh at, but I disappoint your expectations when I don’t. You’re the dirty looks given towards my friends who adorn tattoos and piercings and I know about your attempts in manipulating my parents into believing that my friends are terrible influences for my siblings and I. Unfortunately for you, I won’t fall victim to your games. I will choose who my friends are based solely on their character and nothing else.\n\nI do have to give you credit for your fairness though, Prejudice. You judge everyone equally negative. You base your judgements on the wrongdoings of the a problematic minority and automatically apply it to the innocent majority. For this reason, you believe that Catholics are mindless puppets of the Church and Atheists are cold-hearted with no morals. You neither think about the progressive Catholics nor the charitable Atheists. To you, the affluents do not deserve their wealth but the homeless deserve their poverty. You forget that not all wealthy individuals are filled with greed and not all homeless people are lazy. You don’t consider personal hardships people face when making your judgements. You dismiss the younger generations because of their lack of experience and ignore the elderly because they’re not current with the times. You make assumptions about certain groups of people because the innocent majority don’t matter to you, as long as they’re affiliated with the problematic minority in any form. No one can escape your scrutiny.\n\nPrejudice, you already know how much I hate you. I hate seeing you everywhere I go.You are in books, movies, and on social media. I hear you in the news and in the voices of strangers. What’s worse is that sometimes you appear on the faces of the people I love. I detest everything about you but, did you know there’s something else that I despise even more? I loathe most that I see you every morning in the mirror because as much as I try to distance myself away from you, you’re a part of me too.\n\n\f\n\nSincerely, XXXX Smith\n","source":"DearPrejudice.md","raw":"---\ntitle: Dear Prejudice\nauthor: Trinh Nyugen\nlayout: article\nheaderimage: img/header-dearprejudice.jpg\naccenttext: You make weapons out of words and more than once, aimed your sword at me.

Dante is, after all, literally walking in Virgil’s wake for the entirety of the *Inferno*, and Virgil’s *Aeneid* makes all of Homer’s doubts about the figure explicit, dubbing him “that ringleader of atrocity” (6.709). Homer’s Odysseus is hardly a figure without ambiguity--this is a man who spends the entirety of the *Odyssey’s* twenty-second book murdering men who scarcely have a chance against him, aided as he is by a goddess and hardened by years of war. Leodes has his pleas for his life met with a“lopping blow/ so that his head went down to mouth in dust” (350-370). He thereafter proceeds to directing the murder of Penelope’s handmaidens:\n>“These dead must be disposed of first of all.\nDirect the women.  \nTables and chairs will be  \nScrubbed with sponges, rinsed and rinsed again.  \nTake them outside, these women,  \nBetween the roundhouse and palisade,   \nAnd hack them with your swordblades till you cut  \nThe life out of them, every thought of sweet  \nAphrodite under the rutting sutors,   \nWhere they lay down in secret” (487-496).\n\nSo Odysseus seeks to humiliate these handmaidens before he has them butchered, sifting through the gore of their erstwhile lovers with the full knowledge of their own impending doom.  Thus, the reader of the *Odyssey* is confronted with a bizarre paradox: a man who slaughters suppliants who beg for their lives, and mercilessly orders the deaths of women who, given their servant status, are likely enslaved and therefore entirely unguarded against his whims;  yet this man has the tacit approval of heaven. It is the daughter of the highest god who has aided his journey thus far, and encourages and aids the slaughter (Athena in fact facilitates the test of the bow to “usher bloody slaughter in” at the beginning of Book Twenty-One). Even Virgil’s mutilated Deiphobus gives Ulysses a tacit connection to the heavens: his full nomenclature of Ulysses is, in fact, “that ringleader of atrocity...of the windking’s line (6.709-10). The “windking” being Zeus, the highest of gods (and “son of Laertes in the line of Zeus” is a frequent refrain throughout the Odyssey, another reinforcement of Odysseus’s connection with heaven). This is a strange juxtaposition to encounter, especially for a modern reader, one trained to associate the divine and the heavens with unambiguous moral purity. The presence of Ulysses in Dante’s hell therefore marks a significant change in thinking about such a character. Dante does not merely suggest retribution for the figure’s mythological crimes by condemning him to eternal punishment, but thereby actively severs any connection between Odysseus and the divine that gives him the license to carry out the deeds for which Dante sees him punished.\n\nDante suggests that the greatest suffering of those condemned to hell is the separation from God. Dante’s vision of hell seems to take its inception from the Book of Matthew, in which hell is the “outer darkness” in which there is “weeping and gnashing of teeth,” itself an expression of the misery of being excluded from God’s circle of light (8:12). Dante establishes this theme early in the *Inferno*. His fourth canto sees the Classical poets, although better off by far than the lower circle, condemned by having lived before Christ. Virgil tells Dante:\n>“Though they [the virtuous pagans] have merit,  \nThat is not enough, for they were unbaptized,  \nDenied the gateway to the faith you profess.  \nAnd if they lived before the Christians lived,   \nThey did not worship God aright.  \nAnd among these I am one.  \nFor such defects, and for no other fault,   \nWe are lost, and afflicted but in this,  \nThat without hope we live in longing” (34-42).   \n\nThe “longing” in which these shades live is the longing for God. Their punishment is only to be excluded from such a presence. This fundamental absence of God’s presence is represented throughout by persistent assault on the senses, the presence of foul smells and a suggestion of cloying darkness. In Dante’s fifth canto, in which one finds the circle of the lustful, note is taken of the “malignant air” (86). His eighteenth canto doubles down on this motif: some of the damned are “snuffling with their snouts,” and this motion invokes the images of pigs, often associated with filth (104). “The banks...were coated with a mould/ offending eyes and nose” (104, 106-8). The flatterers and panderers dwell in excrement (113). What the absence of God suggests to Dante is filth and sickness, the inverse of the light and health with which he associates the divine.\n\nIt is the establishment of this theme of distance from God that makes the presence of Ulysses remarkable. After having seen Ulysses’ persistent association with the divine, even in Virgil, in which he is also explicitly condemned for his crimes against the Trojans, it is worth noting that Dante explicitly aligns God against Ulysses. Of Ulysses Virgil says: “Within this flame find torment/ Ulysses and Diomed. They are paired/ In God’s revenge as once they earned his wrath” (26.55-7). For Dante to completely divorce Ulysses from his associations with the divine is to represent a significant change in the way such a character is viewed. Ulysses has, in effect, gone from being a descendent of the highest god, favored and protected by the daughter goddess of the highest god, to being explicitly on the receiving end of the wrath of Dante’s God. The travails of Odysseus and his fellow Greeks are implied to be vengeance for the horrors committed at Troy, a city built by gods. But throughout his travails, Odysseus is never fully separated from the divine in a way that, to Dante, means punishment. On his journey, Odysseus also receives favor from divine figures like Circe and Calypso, even as he receives rancor from figures like Poseidon. Dante casts Ulysses thoroughly out from the graces of the divine, resulting in his eternal condemnation. Even Poseidon’s wrath was impermanent, as was Odysseus’s exile from home. The exile which Dante presents is of a more permanent nature. Since Dante’s hell is a place of exile from God and the divine, for Ulysses to be there represents a change in the way God is viewed.\n\nFor Odysseus to have offended Poseidon, as he does by blinding Polyphemus in Book Nine of the *Odyssey*, is to have alienated himself from one god. The persistent aid of Athena and other divine forces suggests that in a polytheistic religious system, alienation from one god will not result in entire alienation from divine forces and their graces. The naming of Ulysses as being in the line of the “windking” (Zeus) in the *Aeneid* maintains a sense of his being guarded and enclosed by his association with divine forces. This suggests that the scorn of Deiphobus’ shade can do little to touch such a figure, since he is still within “the line of Zeus.” But, of course, within Dante’s religious system, there is but one God rather than a host of them, and to alienate oneself from this God leaves one outside the circle of the divine entirely. The presence of Ulysses in the *Inferno* therefore suggests a drastic change in the view of the divine through the view of one mythological figure. A massive change in the conception of morality is suggested as well. Since, in the polytheistic Greek system one can carry out morally questionable or outright reprehensible behavior and still be likely to retain the favor of some divine forces, as indeed Odysseus does, then this indicates differing sets of rules of conduct that are highly context-dependent. Dante, on the other hand, reveals the change inherent in the Judeo-Christian system and its effect on the conception of morality: one God, and the one unifying set of moral rules and rules of conduct that having one divine force suggests. Ulysses is therefore unshielded by fragmented divine forces from retribution for his conduct in Dante’s view. Having alienated what Dante sees as the only God, Ulysses has effectually been alienated, cast out, from the divine itself. The guard of Athena can hardly be useful to Ulysses in the moral universe of Dante, who would undoubtedly have seen the goddess as part of the cadre of “false and lying gods” which Virgil repudiates (1.72).\n\nThe final fatal journey which Ulysses recounts to Virgil and Dante is itself an important expression of this separation from the divine. His presence in a lower circle of hell than the virtuous pagans is especially noteworthy, as this separation is itself only a further extension of Ulysses’ separation from the divine.  In Dante’s Twenty-Sixth Canto, Ulysses recalls his desire to exceed the boundaries of mortal exploration and knowledge:\n>“Not tenderness for a son, nor filial duty  \nToward my aged father, nor love I owed  \nPenelope that would have made her glad  \nCould overcome the fervor that was mine   \nTo gain experience of the world   \nAnd learn about man’s vices, and his worth…  \nI and my shipmates had grown old and slow  \nBy the time we reached the narrow strait  \nWhere Hercules marked off the limits,  \nWarning all men to go no farther” (94-109).\n\nUlysses has been explicitly condemned to the circle of the fraudulent because of the Trojan Horse, but his final journey represents an implicit reason for punishment as well: Ulysses has pushed against the boundaries of mortality, seeking out knowledge reserved for the divine alone. Ulysses goes on to encourage his men to seek out the world where “no one lives,” a further implication of this realm’s prohibition against mortal knowledge (117). Here, Dante has placed Ulysses again beyond the ken of the divine, implicitly associating him with mortality, and further dissociating him from the privileges of divine knowledge. Ulysses admonishes the reluctance of his men: “Consider how your souls were sown/ you were not made to live like brutes or beasts/ but to pursue virtue and knowledge” (118-20). Here, Ulysses is implicitly encouraging the transgression of a boundary between the divine and the mortal. His pursuit of divine knowledge recalls the transgression of Adam and Eve, eating from the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil, and being subsequently brutally punished for their attempt to access something which can only be the province of God. The dashing to pieces of Ulysses’ ship represents the final divorce of this figure from any divine connections (138). Dante thoroughly reinforces Ulysses’ mortality and exclusion from the realm of the divine not merely with his God-ordained punishment in hell, but with his death, resulting as it does from Ulysses’ attempt to grasp an understanding from which he is excluded by dint of being mortal.     \n\nThe presence of Ulysses in the hell built by Dante is both a commentary on the Classical tradition of such a figure as well as an indicator of the vast change in moral systems represented by the Judeo-Christian tradition within which Dante is working. While Virgil condemns Odysseus for his crimes against the Trojans, he nevertheless maintains a tacit connection between this figure and the divine. Dante does something entirely new by completely divorcing this figure from the divine, and in Dante’s view, therefore any connection to approval or heroism. The presence of Ulysses is a more subtle expression of Dante’s disapproval for the “false and lying gods” of the Greco-Roman world. Dante re-appropriates a figure which had formerly enjoyed some approval by the heavens, however ambiguously he was represented, and thoroughly out casts him from the circle of divine regard. Dante is, through this re-contextualization, representing the shift from the polytheistic system of ancient Greece to the Judeo-Christian tradition, in which one must follow a unifying set of rules in order to avert permanently alienating oneself from the singular divine force which governs Dante’s universe.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n### Works Cited\nDante.

Virgil tells Dante:\n>“Though they [the virtuous pagans] have merit,  \nThat is not enough, for they were unbaptized,  \nDenied the gateway to the faith you profess.  \nAnd if they lived before the Christians lived,   \nThey did not worship God aright.  \nAnd among these I am one.  \nFor such defects, and for no other fault,   \nWe are lost, and afflicted but in this,  \nThat without hope we live in longing” (34-42).   \n\nThe “longing” in which these shades live is the longing for God. Their punishment is only to be excluded from such a presence. This fundamental absence of God’s presence is represented throughout by persistent assault on the senses, the presence of foul smells and a suggestion of cloying darkness. In Dante’s fifth canto, in which one finds the circle of the lustful, note is taken of the “malignant air” (86). His eighteenth canto doubles down on this motif: some of the damned are “snuffling with their snouts,” and this motion invokes the images of pigs, often associated with filth (104). “The banks...were coated with a mould/ offending eyes and nose” (104, 106-8). The flatterers and panderers dwell in excrement (113). What the absence of God suggests to Dante is filth and sickness, the inverse of the light and health with which he associates the divine.\n\nIt is the establishment of this theme of distance from God that makes the presence of Ulysses remarkable. After having seen Ulysses’ persistent association with the divine, even in Virgil, in which he is also explicitly condemned for his crimes against the Trojans, it is worth noting that Dante explicitly aligns God against Ulysses. Of Ulysses Virgil says: “Within this flame find torment/ Ulysses and Diomed. They are paired/ In God’s revenge as once they earned his wrath” (26.55-7). For Dante to completely divorce Ulysses from his associations with the divine is to represent a significant change in the way such a character is viewed. Ulysses has, in effect, gone from being a descendent of the highest god, favored and protected by the daughter goddess of the highest god, to being explicitly on the receiving end of the wrath of Dante’s God. The travails of Odysseus and his fellow Greeks are implied to be vengeance for the horrors committed at Troy, a city built by gods. But throughout his travails, Odysseus is never fully separated from the divine in a way that, to Dante, means punishment. On his journey, Odysseus also receives favor from divine figures like Circe and Calypso, even as he receives rancor from figures like Poseidon. Dante casts Ulysses thoroughly out from the graces of the divine, resulting in his eternal condemnation. Even Poseidon’s wrath was impermanent, as was Odysseus’s exile from home. The exile which Dante presents is of a more permanent nature. Since Dante’s hell is a place of exile from God and the divine, for Ulysses to be there represents a change in the way God is viewed.\n\nFor Odysseus to have offended Poseidon, as he does by blinding Polyphemus in Book Nine of the *Odyssey*, is to have alienated himself from one god. The persistent aid of Athena and other divine forces suggests that in a polytheistic religious system, alienation from one god will not result in entire alienation from divine forces and their graces. The naming of Ulysses as being in the line of the “windking” (Zeus) in the *Aeneid* maintains a sense of his being guarded and enclosed by his association with divine forces. This suggests that the scorn of Deiphobus’ shade can do little to touch such a figure, since he is still within “the line of Zeus.” But, of course, within Dante’s religious system, there is but one God rather than a host of them, and to alienate oneself from this God leaves one outside the circle of the divine entirely. The presence of Ulysses in the *Inferno* therefore suggests a drastic change in the view of the divine through the view of one mythological figure. A massive change in the conception of morality is suggested as well. Since, in the polytheistic Greek system one can carry out morally questionable or outright reprehensible behavior and still be likely to retain the favor of some divine forces, as indeed Odysseus does, then this indicates differing sets of rules of conduct that are highly context-dependent. Dante, on the other hand, reveals the change inherent in the Judeo-Christian system and its effect on the conception of morality: one God, and the one unifying set of moral rules and rules of conduct that having one divine force suggests. Ulysses is therefore unshielded by fragmented divine forces from retribution for his conduct in Dante’s view. Having alienated what Dante sees as the only God, Ulysses has effectually been alienated, cast out, from the divine itself. The guard of Athena can hardly be useful to Ulysses in the moral universe of Dante, who would undoubtedly have seen the goddess as part of the cadre of “false and lying gods” which Virgil repudiates (1.72).\n\nThe final fatal journey which Ulysses recounts to Virgil and Dante is itself an important expression of this separation from the divine. His presence in a lower circle of hell than the virtuous pagans is especially noteworthy, as this separation is itself only a further extension of Ulysses’ separation from the divine.  In Dante’s Twenty-Sixth Canto, Ulysses recalls his desire to exceed the boundaries of mortal exploration and knowledge:\n>“Not tenderness for a son, nor filial duty  \nToward my aged father, nor love I owed  \nPenelope that would have made her glad  \nCould overcome the fervor that was mine   \nTo gain experience of the world   \nAnd learn about man’s vices, and his worth…  \nI and my shipmates had grown old and slow  \nBy the time we reached the narrow strait  \nWhere Hercules marked off the limits,  \nWarning all men to go no farther” (94-109).\n\nUlysses has been explicitly condemned to the circle of the fraudulent because of the Trojan Horse, but his final journey represents an implicit reason for punishment as well: Ulysses has pushed against the boundaries of mortality, seeking out knowledge reserved for the divine alone. Ulysses goes on to encourage his men to seek out the world where “no one lives,” a further implication of this realm’s prohibition against mortal knowledge (117). Here, Dante has placed Ulysses again beyond the ken of the divine, implicitly associating him with mortality, and further dissociating him from the privileges of divine knowledge. Ulysses admonishes the reluctance of his men: “Consider how your souls were sown/ you were not made to live like brutes or beasts/ but to pursue virtue and knowledge” (118-20). Here, Ulysses is implicitly encouraging the transgression of a boundary between the divine and the mortal. His pursuit of divine knowledge recalls the transgression of Adam and Eve, eating from the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil, and being subsequently brutally punished for their attempt to access something which can only be the province of God. The dashing to pieces of Ulysses’ ship represents the final divorce of this figure from any divine connections (138). Dante thoroughly reinforces Ulysses’ mortality and exclusion from the realm of the divine not merely with his God-ordained punishment in hell, but with his death, resulting as it does from Ulysses’ attempt to grasp an understanding from which he is excluded by dint of being mortal.     \n\nThe presence of Ulysses in the hell built by Dante is both a commentary on the Classical tradition of such a figure as well as an indicator of the vast change in moral systems represented by the Judeo-Christian tradition within which Dante is working. While Virgil condemns Odysseus for his crimes against the Trojans, he nevertheless maintains a tacit connection between this figure and the divine. Dante does something entirely new by completely divorcing this figure from the divine, and in Dante’s view, therefore any connection to approval or heroism. The presence of Ulysses is a more subtle expression of Dante’s disapproval for the “false and lying gods” of the Greco-Roman world. Dante re-appropriates a figure which had formerly enjoyed some approval by the heavens, however ambiguously he was represented, and thoroughly out casts him from the circle of divine regard. Dante is, through this re-contextualization, representing the shift from the polytheistic system of ancient Greece to the Judeo-Christian tradition, in which one must follow a unifying set of rules in order to avert permanently alienating oneself from the singular divine force which governs Dante’s universe.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n### Works Cited\nDante.

Dante is, after all, literally walking in Virgil’s wake for the entirety of the <em>Inferno</em>, and Virgil’s <em>Aeneid</em> makes all of Homer’s doubts about the figure explicit, dubbing him “that ringleader of atrocity” (6.709). Homer’s Odysseus is hardly a figure without ambiguity–this is a man who spends the entirety of the <em>Odyssey’s</em> twenty-second book murdering men who scarcely have a chance against him, aided as he is by a goddess and hardened by years of war. Leodes has his pleas for his life met with a“lopping blow/ so that his head went down to mouth in dust” (350-370). He thereafter proceeds to directing the murder of Penelope’s handmaidens:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“These dead must be disposed of first of all.<br>Direct the women.<br>Tables and chairs will be<br>Scrubbed with sponges, rinsed and rinsed again.<br>Take them outside, these women,<br>Between the roundhouse and palisade,<br>And hack them with your swordblades till you cut<br>The life out of them, every thought of sweet<br>Aphrodite under the rutting sutors,<br>Where they lay down in secret” (487-496).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So Odysseus seeks to humiliate these handmaidens before he has them butchered, sifting through the gore of their erstwhile lovers with the full knowledge of their own impending doom.  Thus, the reader of the <em>Odyssey</em> is confronted with a bizarre paradox: a man who slaughters suppliants who beg for their lives, and mercilessly orders the deaths of women who, given their servant status, are likely enslaved and therefore entirely unguarded against his whims;  yet this man has the tacit approval of heaven. It is the daughter of the highest god who has aided his journey thus far, and encourages and aids the slaughter (Athena in fact facilitates the test of the bow to “usher bloody slaughter in” at the beginning of Book Twenty-One). Even Virgil’s mutilated Deiphobus gives Ulysses a tacit connection to the heavens: his full nomenclature of Ulysses is, in fact, “that ringleader of atrocity…of the windking’s line (6.709-10). The “windking” being Zeus, the highest of gods (and “son of Laertes in the line of Zeus” is a frequent refrain throughout the Odyssey, another reinforcement of Odysseus’s connection with heaven). This is a strange juxtaposition to encounter, especially for a modern reader, one trained to associate the divine and the heavens with unambiguous moral purity. The presence of Ulysses in Dante’s hell therefore marks a significant change in thinking about such a character. Dante does not merely suggest retribution for the figure’s mythological crimes by condemning him to eternal punishment, but thereby actively severs any connection between Odysseus and the divine that gives him the license to carry out the deeds for which Dante sees him punished.</p>\n<p>Dante suggests that the greatest suffering of those condemned to hell is the separation from God.

I'd like to be a professor someday.\n\n## Sam Lyons\n*Rhonda the Honda*\nEnglish Major - Class of 2018\n\nI'm currently a Junior and an English major. I'm a big fan of Romantic era literature as well as Gothic and contemporary horror. Some of my favorite poets and writers are Percy and Mary Shelley, Stephen King, Edgar Allan Poe, H.P. Lovecraft, John Keats, and other British romantics. \n\n## Albert Mancao\n*Vengeance, The Knight, and Batman: High Art In Comics and Cartoons*\nEnglish Major - Class of 2020\n\nI grew up in a little town called Pennsauken which is a stone's throw away from Camden. I intend on becoming a fiction writer; however, life would most likely turn me into a guidance counselor or something else that isn't a writer. To describe me in three words, I would consider myself as hilarious, skilled, and gorgeous, but others--\"realists\" is what they like to call themselves--would describe me as delusional, arrogant, and a 5/10 at best. \n\n## Breanna Ransom\n*Winter*\nEnglish Major - Class of 2017\n\nBreanna's inherent love of language has reached new depths over the course of her undergraduate education at Rutgers State University, Camden Campus. As an avid reader and writer of both creative and academic works, she's found her most rewarding endeavors include advocating for the Humanities and utilizing her background in Linguistics and Anthropology to understand and harness the implications and power of language. Breanna has recently accepted an offer of admission to RUC's graduate program and will begin working toward earning her Master of Arts in English in Fall 2017. She would like to thank her Creative Writing instructor, Adam Janos, for essentially providing a space in which the short story Winter had the opportunity to develop and reach its full potential.\n\n\n## Aisha Bilala\n*Smells like Home*\n\nI love it here at Rutgers-Camden. \n\n## Trinh Nguyen\n*Dear Prejudice*\nBiology Major - Class of 2020\n\nI’m currently a Freshman student in biology and my dream is to become a doctor. When I’m not working or studying, I like to relax and have fun. Some of my hobbies are painting, playing tennis, and listening to music. \n\n\n\n## Clara Cribb\n*Depressive Ways*\nFine Arts Major/English Minor - Class of 2018\n\nI’m currently living in Trenton, NJ. I’m transfer student from Bloomfield College in Bloomfield, NJ. I love the different aspects that are associated with art: painting, photography, video, sewing, etc. Creating an entity with your hands and the mind is something that I’ve always been fascinated with. My current focus is painting, but I love to experiment with photography.\n\n## Samantha Procida\n*The Cave*\nEnglish Major - Class of 2017\n\nSamantha Procida is a senior majoring in English and minoring in Art and Digital Studies at Rutgers Camden. She aims to bring the humanities into the digital age by creating narratives for online platforms. Currently, she’s working on a meta fiction webcomic called Breaking The 4th Wall.\n\n## John Patouhas\n*That Perfect Girl is Gone*\nTheatre/English Major - Class of 2017\n\n\nJohn Patouhas is a theatre/English major in his junior year. He has worked at the Writing Design Lab on campus for almost 2 years.

The princesses have littered young children's bedrooms, theme parks and films for nearly a century and in turn have become a large topic of debate and observation. These conversations vary from praise to criticism; the focus has been on the ever-changing portrayal of female independence, strength and sexuality throughout the years. Snow White from the film *Snow White and the Seven Dwarves* represents a positive portrayal of female repression and restriction, while Pocahontas from the film *Pocahontas* represents a positive portrayal of female freedom. Elsa from the film *Frozen* acts as a bridge between these two, looking to exhibit the dangers of female restrictions such as Snow White and the celebration of female liberation and freedom such as Pocahontas, which paints her as a three-dimensional heroine exhibiting this progression. However I look to argue that, despite popular opinions and social media reactions to *Frozen*, Elsa is definitely not the first female heroine to exhibit independence, a healthy sexual expression or strength. I would like to show how there has been a gradual linear progression of these aspects all along that has increasingly improved over time, rather than overnight. I look to make this argument by examining the expression of female sexuality and independence and how it has progressed over time in different ways through three Disney heroines.\n\nOur three heroines can be seen as examples of how females presented different stages of independence and sexual expression in film. Nearly eighty years ago we were introduced to the beautiful and innocent, yet passive Snow White. Displaying the beauty ideals of a young female and the part which she plays in society in her film, Snow White can be looked at as an example of how females were expected to be behave. Flash forward nearly fifty-seven years and we’re introduced to an entirely different type of heroine; the Native American Pocahontas proves to show a different side of what a female character can possibly be. An independent, free-spirited daydreamer, Pocahontas plays a much more active role in her life and is portrayed as a liberated and powerful character. In an icy blast we find ourselves in present day where just less than two years ago we were introduced to the Snow Queen of Arendelle. We see this character go from the villain of the original tale to a complex anti-hero of the final film. Not only does Elsa offer us a celebration of an independent and powerful female character, but she also the shows downfall of restricting such strengths.\n\nWhen we are discussing the roles a female character plays in relation to the stereotypical gender roles and the portrayal of her independence the female’s expression of sexuality is a pivotal plot point. In family films like these we usually see sexuality as an underlying theme, being expressed through various symbols and subtle characterizations. The expression of female sexuality has gone through many different steps to get to where we are today. Snow White is presented as the idealized patriarchal figure of what women should emulate: Snow White is non-sexual, conservative, naïve, innocent and passive. Her character design includes a long dress, a modest neckline, and hair done-up tightly while her body language can be described as modest, restricted and proper. All of these physical traits can easily play into the ideal of how women “should” think and behave. An important symbol in the film for sexuality is the apple. With the allusion to the temptation of Eve in the Garden of Eden, Snow White's apple symbolizes a sexual and deadly temptation, sending an underlying message of the “danger” of a female expressing her “sinful” sexuality. We see this apple offered by the only other female character. This further paints the image that all sin arises from the temptation of females (those who don’t emulate Snow White's brand of innocence). Snow White effectively “dies” from even one taste of this “sin” only to be rescued by a man. I believe that this not only places Snow White in a helpless role, but also sends a message that sexuality is only appropriate or redeemable when it’s a male perpetrating the action.\n\nIf we’re to compare Snow White to Pocahontas, it’s almost the complete opposite. Looking at character design we see Pocahontas as having a more curvy or sexualized image, with a short dress, an off-the-shoulder neckline, all completed with her hair down. Hair can act as a symbol for sexuality or expressive freedom. Specifically in that Snow White's uptight, structured and modest hair style offers a glimpse into her conservative role concerning sexuality while Pocahontas's raven hair frequently seen flowing in the wind can be looked at as more sexually liberated. Pocahontas also sports a tattoo, which would be hard to imagine on Snow White. Tattoos in literature are often symbols of individuality or freedom of expression. This sense of freedom is very important in her characterization. “Pocahontas has her mother's spirit, she goes wherever the wind takes her” are the first words spoken of her. Her character is also frequently seen running and jumping throughout the film, a clear contrast from Snow White's reserved body language. This introduction to her character paints her as a free-spirited woman living without the restrictions of characters like Snow White. However, the aspect of her more sexual image that is holding this character back from being fully progressive is arguably the fact that her sexual expression is still very much in relation to the entertainment of the male gaze. This is due to her story being based around her male relationships and the attention she receives from men. There’s a thin line between designing a sexually confident and expressive female character and designing a female character placing emphasis on “sex appeal.” I believe Pocahontas certainly walks this line which potentially hinders her progression and independence by still placing some of her sexual expression on the dependence on men.\n\nWe observe the character Queen Elsa as she brings our ideas here full circle. I believe Elsa offers a middle ground between these two ideas. These are presented in the initial portrayal of her conservative and restricted nature similar to Snow White to her eventual liberation and freedom of Pocahontas. Elsa's character design includes two different dresses. Her first, more conservative style includes an tightly done up hairstyle akin to Snow White. She sports a floor length dress, cape and symbolic gloves. Gloves in literature and films often symbolize the concealing of true motives, desires, sexuality or power. The gloves are ripped off both figuratively and literally during her transition to her next style. Her second dress is not just a pretty dress but offers a glimpse at symbolism for female sexuality. This style includes an icy blue dress with a slit in the leg, which hints at an openness towards female sexuality, and a long icy cape. During this transition we also see her undoing her hair in a dramatic fashion, figuratively and literally “letting her hair down,” similarly changing from Snow White's up-do to Pocahontas's freely flowing locks. In addition, we see many instances of body language playing into this symbolic embracing of female sexuality. During this change we see Elsa swinging her hips and freely throwing her arms up while “letting it go.” What I believe is most important here is that  this act of sexual liberation doesn’t have to be in position to entertain a man. Arguably, we couldn’t say this for Pocahontas whose story still very much places emphasis on men. Too often female sexuality, when it’s not condemned, is looked at as something that's sole purpose is for the pleasing of men, as we see here that there was no John Smith or Prince Charming character for which she felt the need to impress. She never even has any sort of male love interest in the film at all, this symbolic sexual liberation takes place when she is completely by herself. This further shows Elsa’s sexual liberation coming from her accepting who she is and the powers she has. Female sexual liberation or expression can and should be born out of one's own self-confidence and independence rather than being centered around male attention. It’s also important to observe the stages from shame to celebration through the portrayal of her initial conservative and fearful mindset to her eventual liberation and fearlessness. At the beginning we see many instances of the dangers of holding oneself back. She sings, “Be the good girl you always have to be, conceal, don't feel, put on a show.” Many girls in society before and even today are commonly raised to sit down and be quiet and to not be open with one's sexuality the ways boys are. We see through Elsa just how a woman can be negatively affected by being taught these things and “putting on a show.” I believe that her powers over ice and snow represent something more than just a magical aspect of the film. The way this magic is treated seems to symbolize female sexuality; it’s something beautiful and completely natural, but is shunned and shamed. Her parents forcing her to wear gloves to conceal her supernatural powers further shows this type of restriction she has been taught. So much so that when her true self is finally revealed, she reacts with fear and shame, showcasing the dangers of these strict standards and restrictions. However, her liberation and independence is celebrated, becoming a pivotal point in the film. The song “Let it Go” can be analyzed as having an underlying sexual liberation theme. The embracing of female freedom and sexuality and the rejection of strict regulations offer a much better and healthier message to audiences rather than the promotion of female conservativeness, innocence and non-sexuality. The repression of one’s sexuality due to societal expectations is shown in this film as a dangerous mindset. Her icy powers only caused her trouble when she had this mindset.\n\nConcerning sexuality and gender roles, the role that romance plays and the role of the men opposite these women offers an obvious relation. In the film *Snow White and the Seven Dwarves*, Snow White meets her love interest, a nameless prince, and immediately falls in love. We have seen how Snow White is an idealized image of what a woman was supposed to be, and here she assumes one of the “acceptable” roles a woman could hold, that of the wife. The archetype of the Damsel in Distress is present within the character of Snow White. We see the Prince as the Hero, saving Snow White, who’s rendered helpless until he kisses her. I believe that this entire scene shows her role of sexuality being condemned. As discussed before, the sexual symbol of the apple puts her in a sleeping death, which is only redeemed when the male comes and plays the active role. Despite the themes that this story seems to promote, placing full dependence on love or a man to save your life is simply not a healthy way to live.\n\nThe film *Pocahontas* introduces us to the fictitious romance between Powhatan Princess Pocahontas and English Explorer John Smith. Their love story offers a much more complex pairing versus Snow White and her nameless rent-a-prince. The gender roles of this love story, especially compared to Snow White seem to be counter-stereotypical. An interesting study done by Dawn England examined each movie and describes each instance of these Disney characters exhibiting stereotypical “masculine” and “feminine” gender roles. This study observed the masculine traits in characters, examples involve such stereotypical male traits in fairy tales ranging from brave to violent. Conversely the feminine traits taken into consideration in this study include things like docile or gentleness. According to England’s study, Pocahontas exhibits 105 “masculine” versus 130 “feminine,” this is much closer to equal than Snow White exhibiting only 13 instances of the masculine gender role, and 137 feminine (558). This is a stark contrast that statistically shows the difference between Snow White and Pocahontas' relation to gender roles, which heavily reflects upon their roles in their romances. A prime example of this reversal of gender roles is seen upon John Smith's near execution. As we see, it is Pocahontas who is throwing her body over John, willing to sacrifice her own life for his. This places Pocahontas in a position of power and dominance and John Smith in a role of helplessness, effectively eliminating that aspect of the damsel in distress motif. The woman is no longer needs to be saved but she is now the savior. Also unlike her poison apple eating predecessor, I have found that Pocahontas takes the notion that she “needs to be saved” as an insult. This is seen in an earlier scene when John Smith tells Pocahontas how he and his fellow Englishmen have “improved the lives of savages everywhere” to which she takes obvious insult. This negative reaction to needing to be saved is important to note in discussions of the “female needing rescue” motif. Another major difference in the love story of this film is in its ending. Upon John Smith needing to return to England he extends Pocahontas an invitation to join him but she declines.  While the film is ultimately based upon romance, Pocahontas is no damsel in distress, and places her priority on her family and her people rather than chasing romantic love, further painting her as a strong woman independent from men. Unlike Snow White, she does not assume the “acceptable” role as a man's wife. I believe all of these things go to show that romantic relations do not always have to act as a hindrance to female strength and that there is power of family over romance, both of which are further expanded upon in later films.\n\nTaking this evolution a step above Pocahontas, for the first time our heroine, Elsa, never has a love interest at all. In fact there is little to no mention of Elsa's romantic life in the film. Her story simply does not need to involve a man; her emotions, motives and aspirations are more than complex enough to tell a story. While a female's romantic relationships don’t have to be a threat to her characterization, it’s important to show a heroine whose story doesn’t have to involve such themes in the first place. This is an obvious intentional message to send, and is where Elsa comes in a step above Pocahontas. However, Elsa's relationship to other men concerning her role as a woman is still important to her story. I observe Elsa as a symbol of a threat to male power. Upon the revelation of her magic, she’s immediately demonized mostly by the men around her. It’s also important to note that this revelation takes place during Elsa's coronation as queen. She’s already literally displaying her political power as queen, to which certain characters look to exploit. Specifically the character of The Duke of Weaselton, thinking out loud upon entering the palace he says “Open those gates so I may unlock your secrets and exploit your riches!” This is why Elsa's powers are so frightening to him: he proclaims Elsa as a “monster” because she has a power, which he doesn’t understand and therefore cannot effectively control. She has the ability to do something that’s out of the control of men and that scares them. Their only chance is to try to tear her down by demonizing her magic. Historically, this theme is exemplified with many “Witch Hunts” throughout history, where, due to a fear of women gaining power, many girls would be falsely accused of evil magic. It’s not a coincidence that “evil” witches are stereotypically female. Elsa's overcoming of this patriarchal demonization of her supernatural and political power proves to be a dire aspect in the film. As we see, unlike Snow White, men can be, and often are, the very source of the main conflict rather than the solution.\n\nWhen observing a female character's independence from men it’s important to observe the nature of the relationships she forms with fellow women. Many female relationships too often fall to the sidelines, or into one category; competition. When fellow women are seen only as competition for male affection it severely hinders her independence. Just like Snow White's only female-to-female relationship with the Evil Queen. “Since physical appearance has traditionally been the most valuable asset for a woman, beauty makes her eligible for marriage, it should come as no surprise that anyone considered superior in beauty is an enemy that must be destroyed.” (González). We see this as an example in the Evil Queen's vice being born out of her envy of Snow White being “Fairest of them all”. As González indicates, this motive is a result of the importance society has--and still--places on female beauty and attractiveness. Expanding upon this idea, the Queen’s vanity and evilness play into one of only two categories most female characters fell into. Usually a female character was either the good “virgin” or the evil “whore.” González describes the Queen in relation to this “virgin-whore motif as, “The old, fallen woman, as the representation of the world of experience from which the heroine must be preserved, is introduced as a threat to the eternal state of innocence in which a woman is expected to remain” (204). It would seem that a woman who doesn’t remain in a state of innocence or male dependence is a menace. To expand on this idea, I observe the intention of these characterizations is for the audience to be conditioned to see Snow White’s innocence and dependence on a man as a positive aspects and, as discussed before, ideals for how women were supposed to act, while the Queen’s independence, power, and lack of a King is portrayed along with negativity, jealousy and evilness, how a woman was expected to oppose. This paints female independence as something that can only be seen in one who is threatening and harmful. This “Virgin versus Whore” motif proves to be overall problematic as it overly simplifies the portrayal of what a woman could be in film and society and demonizes females with power independent from men.\n\nWhile Snow White's only female-to-female exchange came in the form of a deadly competition with a jealous queen, we see Pocahontas forming positive and rewarding relationships with other females. Pocahontas's very first interaction within her film is with her female best friend, Nakoma. The nature of their relationship is not one of rivalry or competition for a man's affection, but rather of protection and mutual support. Upon learning of Pocahontas's relationship with a white settler, Nakoma's reaction does not include any jealousy or rivalry but rather she caringly and concerningly grabs her hand and says, “Pocahontas, please. You're my best friend. I don't want you to get hurt.” The caring nature of her best friend lends to the idea that females can and should protect and build each other up, rather than tear each other down in the name of a man.  I believe this relationship was written to further show that female characters only motives don’t have to involve male affection. However, we often see Pocahontas not listening to Nakoma's caring voice of reason, and we still see this relationship as secondary to the romance and too often falls to the sidelines in favor of her relationship with a man. The historical figure of Pocahontas offers many interesting stories and lessons yet the film and design of her character definitely gravitate towards her male relationships. While this female relationship is positively portrayed and rewarding, we don’t see female-to-female bonds as a focus of a film until 2013's Frozen.\n\nThe relationship Elsa has with her sister Anna is important because it is the main course of the film rather than a side dish. It shows the strength of the sisterly bond has in place of romantic bonds. One aspect of their relationship that comes into play when discussing the ideals of feminism within the film is their differing views of romance. Elsa responds to Anna’s engagement by saying, “What do you understand about true love? You can't marry a man you just met,” effectively crushing the dreams of the majority of her fellow Disney princesses. This viewpoint proves to be quite useful as the character whom Anna wished to marry, Hans, is revealed to be the true antagonist of the film. I believe this twist serves to show the fault of the “love at first sight” motif that is all too common in fairy tales. It’s not always a good idea to wed the first guy who sings a duet with you. Sure, in real life maybe he won't try to kill you and your sister and take your kingdom, but Elsa’s maturity and caring for her sister in this situation further paints her as a powerful and independent female role model. In fact, the “act of true love” comes from their sisterly bond, rather than a man. This aspect of their relationship is crucial. We see Anna sacrificing herself to save Elsa's life from the man she was almost ready to marry. However, not only does her act of sacrifice manage to save Elsa's life, it has in turn saved Anna's as her frozen heart begins to thaw. They have effectively saved each other's lives without the help of Prince Charming. The hero-damsel motif isn’t just reversed, it is dismantled in this example. We have seen *Snow White's* conflict a result of a female and her solution coming from a man saving the girl. In *Pocahontas* we then see the girl being the one to save the man. However with *Frozen* we see the problem stemming from men and a female-to-female bond being the ultimate solution. The film's entire main focus being on the power of strong female relationships and independence from men is an excellent example of the evolution from the days of poison apples.\n\n To expand on this traditionally negative connotation of female independence, I believe we see Elsa have more in common with the female villains of the past, such as the Evil Queen, rather than the supposed heroines: “Female independence has traditionally been perceived as a menace for the order established by patriarchal society, A woman who decides not to adapt herself to the traditional roles is seen as going against what nature has intended for her” (González 203).  If we are to draw a comparison between The Snow Queen of 2013 and The Evil Queen of 1937, it is easy to identify the evolution. They both hold absolute monarch political power without a king; They both practice some sort of supernatural magic; They are both powerful, independent and misunderstood and shunned by their community. However, the portrayal of Elsa as a protagonist rather than an antagonist is crucial. The Evil Queen is written as a purely evil villain, demonized by both the audience and producers, as González has mentioned. While Elsa is portrayed as heroic and misunderstood, feeling the negative effects of such attitudes held by the men in her world against female power and independence. An important comparison to draw upon is the use of the word “fool.” This word has become a favorite amongst villains such as Maleficent and the Evil Queen, often used to demean their henchmen or the protagonist. However Elsa uses it in a different way. “I'm such a fool, I can't be free” she sings. The only difference here is Elsa is directing the word at herself rather than others, tying her to the villain the men in the world lead her to believe she is. It shows a sort of internalized self-criticism taught to girls who dare to exhibit the independence, power, or differences traditionally portrayed by villains. Another aspect that is pivotal to their understanding is the intended reaction for these characters from their respective audiences. The audience of 1937’s *Snow White & The Seven Dwarfs* is lead to see the powerful and independent female as a threat, with negative intentions, wicked jealousy and disregard. However, the audience of 2013’s *Frozen* is lead to see this powerful and independent female as a misunderstood hero, one who takes control of her own destiny and sets a good example. Female independence doesn’t have to come from jealous and evil villains, but can and should be born out of heroines. One may argue that with the female villains, Disney has been portraying strong and independent females all along. However, I would argue that there is an underlying negative message in portraying these things in antagonists. It would seem as though it is saying that females exhibiting these strengths and powers are doomed to be defeated, and receive an unhappy ending. While powerless and weaker female characters are the ones that receive, or “deserve” a happy ending. When self-sufficiency, sexuality and strength in female characters is only shown in the evil villains it provides an overall negative connotation to an audience of impressionable young kids. This makes protagonists displaying these traits all the more important.\n\nMusic plays an important role, not only in the plot development, but also in offering a look into the messages of the films as well. Snow White sings the song “Someday My Prince Will Come.” The title itself lends to the passive dependence women were expected to take within romance and life that we have previously discussed. In the present day it is easy to see how this message doesn’t exactly work. Taken directly from the piece, “Wedding bells will ring, Someday when my dreams come true”. This presents the idea that a woman’s “dreams coming true” usually only involving “wedding bells ringing”. The way this idea is presented in the song is as if the only acceptable dream for women is being a wife dependent on males, which goes back to Snow White’s overall portrayal being based upon the strict standards and ideals society had for females.\n\nIn Pocahontas’ “Just Around the Riverbend,” “Pocahontas’ dissatisfaction subverts the conventions of previous Disney songs” (Zarranz 58). This song presents her dissatisfaction with another character, Kocoum's, marriage proposal. Pocahontas sings that she “ignores the sound of distant drumming” for a “handsome sturdy husband who builds handsome sturdy walls.” Along with this contrast, another interesting example of this subversion is in lyrics, from Snow White's “Dreams Coming True” when “Wedding Bells Ring,” to Pocahontas singing “Should I Marry Kocoum? Is All My Dreaming at an End?” This direct contrast not only paints a woman's dreams as something more than just finding a handsome, sturdy husband, but also showing that it could in fact signal the end of her dreams. So while Snow White exhibits the idealized and ultimately outdated and harmful concept that a woman's wedding is the pinnacle of her life, Pocahontas exhibits the opposite. This song rather paints marriage as something she is dreading, rather than dreaming of. The song also paints Pocahontas as a very active part of her love life. While Snow White may sit at the riverbank waiting for high tide to bring in whatever prince she sings a duet with first, Pocahontas jumps right in, listens to her heart and wants to make her own decisions in her romantic life.\n\nJust like discussed previously, Elsa's story and song “Let it Go” do not involve romantic love in the first place. While Snow White sings about a dream marriage proposal, and Pocahontas sings of a rejection of such concepts, Elsa's main number is about her own liberation and power. This takes the ideas of female independence and freedom a step above Pocahontas and a leap above Snow White. Many lines of the song lend to the ideas of female independence, power and even underlying tones of sexual liberation. From the first verse's “I couldn't keep it in, heaven knows I tried” to the second verse's “The fears that once controlled me, can't get to me at all” addresses the restrictions Elsa, and many females, have experienced through both historic and modern society's impossible standards for women. Elsa associates her power with fear and misunderstanding, but within this number we see not only acceptance, but celebration of being powerful. This also examines the danger of women living with such restrictions over their lives. Those restrictions only serve to create a sense of shame, fear and inequality from their male counterparts. “Let it Go” definitely ties us back to the ideas of sexual liberation through various undertones in the lyrics. The lyric that I believe sums up the entire idea of the song comes in the final chorus, “Let it go and I'll rise like the break of dawn, let it go That perfect girl is gone, here I stand in the light of day.” “That Perfect Girl is Gone” not only excellently sums up the message of this song and film, but of the entire idea that I’m researching. The strive for perfection and unrealistic standards of beauty, femininity and the roles women are “supposed” to play in society are harmful and effectively “let go.” While, Elsa shows us the harms when we try to abide by these outdated expectations of Snow White, she also exhibits the liberation experienced when they are let go and is free and liberated similar to Pocahontas and takes it a step further.\n\nWhile the strives the Disney studios have made in terms of their portrayals of female independence within their films has proven to be quite progressive, it’s important to note that even the most recent characters and films aren’t without issues in terms of gender relations and equality. While, as discussed, it’s healthy for female sexuality to be more freely expressed, there is a line to be drawn between portraying females that are confident with their sexuality and females designed simply for sex appeal. This isn’t to say that certain misguided decisions behind the scenes totally discredit the positive aspects of these characters. An interesting project that I have come across called the “RealPrincess” which I found to be an excellent example of putting pressure on Disney studios to expand even further with their feminist evolution. This project entailed girls drawing their version of “Real Princesses” which included princess who were either non-attractive, plus-sized, disabled, gay, transgender, and other aspects not yet explored by Disney. We’ve seen unattractive males as protagonists but all of the females have been relatively pretty. I would like to think conversations like this would encourage a mainstream and popular studio like Disney to display these people's different stories to their broad audience and would just hope that the audience would be receptive these different Princesses. However, if there is any criticism of this article, I would say that the strawman fallacy is utilized here by setting up these characters as easier to knock down. “One of the most nefarious aspects of the traditional Disney princess model is the stereotypical, hyper-feminine ideals their narratives promote” (Zellinger 3). The author seems to broadly generalize all of Disney's female protagonists by the older stereotype of helpless damsels in distress in order to further make their argument. I feel Pocahontas, Mulan and Elsa are important points of progression, although their role as relatively attractive females remain. It is important to keep a certain amount of pressure on our media to keep striving to improve the portrayals of females, however, it is also important to still offer praise and encouragement for improvements that we do see.\n\nThese three characters offer a glimpse into the overall evolution of female characters within Disney films. Putting them side by side we see how the portrayals of female liberation has gradually improved, results varying from a passive, naïve and virginal young girl to confident, strong willed and three-dimensional young women. It seems the further we venture into demonstrating complexity, independence and imperfections in females the closer we get to achieving the perfect female role model.\n\n### Works Cited\nEngland, D.

The princesses have littered young children's bedrooms, theme parks and films for nearly a century and in turn have become a large topic of debate and observation. These conversations vary from praise to criticism; the focus has been on the ever-changing portrayal of female independence, strength and sexuality throughout the years. Snow White from the film *Snow White and the Seven Dwarves* represents a positive portrayal of female repression and restriction, while Pocahontas from the film *Pocahontas* represents a positive portrayal of female freedom. Elsa from the film *Frozen* acts as a bridge between these two, looking to exhibit the dangers of female restrictions such as Snow White and the celebration of female liberation and freedom such as Pocahontas, which paints her as a three-dimensional heroine exhibiting this progression. However I look to argue that, despite popular opinions and social media reactions to *Frozen*, Elsa is definitely not the first female heroine to exhibit independence, a healthy sexual expression or strength. I would like to show how there has been a gradual linear progression of these aspects all along that has increasingly improved over time, rather than overnight. I look to make this argument by examining the expression of female sexuality and independence and how it has progressed over time in different ways through three Disney heroines.\n\nOur three heroines can be seen as examples of how females presented different stages of independence and sexual expression in film. Nearly eighty years ago we were introduced to the beautiful and innocent, yet passive Snow White. Displaying the beauty ideals of a young female and the part which she plays in society in her film, Snow White can be looked at as an example of how females were expected to be behave. Flash forward nearly fifty-seven years and we’re introduced to an entirely different type of heroine; the Native American Pocahontas proves to show a different side of what a female character can possibly be. An independent, free-spirited daydreamer, Pocahontas plays a much more active role in her life and is portrayed as a liberated and powerful character. In an icy blast we find ourselves in present day where just less than two years ago we were introduced to the Snow Queen of Arendelle. We see this character go from the villain of the original tale to a complex anti-hero of the final film. Not only does Elsa offer us a celebration of an independent and powerful female character, but she also the shows downfall of restricting such strengths.\n\nWhen we are discussing the roles a female character plays in relation to the stereotypical gender roles and the portrayal of her independence the female’s expression of sexuality is a pivotal plot point. In family films like these we usually see sexuality as an underlying theme, being expressed through various symbols and subtle characterizations. The expression of female sexuality has gone through many different steps to get to where we are today. Snow White is presented as the idealized patriarchal figure of what women should emulate: Snow White is non-sexual, conservative, naïve, innocent and passive. Her character design includes a long dress, a modest neckline, and hair done-up tightly while her body language can be described as modest, restricted and proper. All of these physical traits can easily play into the ideal of how women “should” think and behave. An important symbol in the film for sexuality is the apple. With the allusion to the temptation of Eve in the Garden of Eden, Snow White's apple symbolizes a sexual and deadly temptation, sending an underlying message of the “danger” of a female expressing her “sinful” sexuality. We see this apple offered by the only other female character. This further paints the image that all sin arises from the temptation of females (those who don’t emulate Snow White's brand of innocence). Snow White effectively “dies” from even one taste of this “sin” only to be rescued by a man. I believe that this not only places Snow White in a helpless role, but also sends a message that sexuality is only appropriate or redeemable when it’s a male perpetrating the action.\n\nIf we’re to compare Snow White to Pocahontas, it’s almost the complete opposite. Looking at character design we see Pocahontas as having a more curvy or sexualized image, with a short dress, an off-the-shoulder neckline, all completed with her hair down. Hair can act as a symbol for sexuality or expressive freedom. Specifically in that Snow White's uptight, structured and modest hair style offers a glimpse into her conservative role concerning sexuality while Pocahontas's raven hair frequently seen flowing in the wind can be looked at as more sexually liberated. Pocahontas also sports a tattoo, which would be hard to imagine on Snow White. Tattoos in literature are often symbols of individuality or freedom of expression. This sense of freedom is very important in her characterization. “Pocahontas has her mother's spirit, she goes wherever the wind takes her” are the first words spoken of her. Her character is also frequently seen running and jumping throughout the film, a clear contrast from Snow White's reserved body language. This introduction to her character paints her as a free-spirited woman living without the restrictions of characters like Snow White. However, the aspect of her more sexual image that is holding this character back from being fully progressive is arguably the fact that her sexual expression is still very much in relation to the entertainment of the male gaze. This is due to her story being based around her male relationships and the attention she receives from men. There’s a thin line between designing a sexually confident and expressive female character and designing a female character placing emphasis on “sex appeal.” I believe Pocahontas certainly walks this line which potentially hinders her progression and independence by still placing some of her sexual expression on the dependence on men.\n\nWe observe the character Queen Elsa as she brings our ideas here full circle. I believe Elsa offers a middle ground between these two ideas. These are presented in the initial portrayal of her conservative and restricted nature similar to Snow White to her eventual liberation and freedom of Pocahontas. Elsa's character design includes two different dresses. Her first, more conservative style includes an tightly done up hairstyle akin to Snow White. She sports a floor length dress, cape and symbolic gloves. Gloves in literature and films often symbolize the concealing of true motives, desires, sexuality or power. The gloves are ripped off both figuratively and literally during her transition to her next style. Her second dress is not just a pretty dress but offers a glimpse at symbolism for female sexuality. This style includes an icy blue dress with a slit in the leg, which hints at an openness towards female sexuality, and a long icy cape. During this transition we also see her undoing her hair in a dramatic fashion, figuratively and literally “letting her hair down,” similarly changing from Snow White's up-do to Pocahontas's freely flowing locks. In addition, we see many instances of body language playing into this symbolic embracing of female sexuality. During this change we see Elsa swinging her hips and freely throwing her arms up while “letting it go.” What I believe is most important here is that  this act of sexual liberation doesn’t have to be in position to entertain a man. Arguably, we couldn’t say this for Pocahontas whose story still very much places emphasis on men. Too often female sexuality, when it’s not condemned, is looked at as something that's sole purpose is for the pleasing of men, as we see here that there was no John Smith or Prince Charming character for which she felt the need to impress. She never even has any sort of male love interest in the film at all, this symbolic sexual liberation takes place when she is completely by herself. This further shows Elsa’s sexual liberation coming from her accepting who she is and the powers she has. Female sexual liberation or expression can and should be born out of one's own self-confidence and independence rather than being centered around male attention. It’s also important to observe the stages from shame to celebration through the portrayal of her initial conservative and fearful mindset to her eventual liberation and fearlessness. At the beginning we see many instances of the dangers of holding oneself back. She sings, “Be the good girl you always have to be, conceal, don't feel, put on a show.” Many girls in society before and even today are commonly raised to sit down and be quiet and to not be open with one's sexuality the ways boys are. We see through Elsa just how a woman can be negatively affected by being taught these things and “putting on a show.” I believe that her powers over ice and snow represent something more than just a magical aspect of the film. The way this magic is treated seems to symbolize female sexuality; it’s something beautiful and completely natural, but is shunned and shamed. Her parents forcing her to wear gloves to conceal her supernatural powers further shows this type of restriction she has been taught. So much so that when her true self is finally revealed, she reacts with fear and shame, showcasing the dangers of these strict standards and restrictions. However, her liberation and independence is celebrated, becoming a pivotal point in the film. The song “Let it Go” can be analyzed as having an underlying sexual liberation theme. The embracing of female freedom and sexuality and the rejection of strict regulations offer a much better and healthier message to audiences rather than the promotion of female conservativeness, innocence and non-sexuality. The repression of one’s sexuality due to societal expectations is shown in this film as a dangerous mindset. Her icy powers only caused her trouble when she had this mindset.\n\nConcerning sexuality and gender roles, the role that romance plays and the role of the men opposite these women offers an obvious relation. In the film *Snow White and the Seven Dwarves*, Snow White meets her love interest, a nameless prince, and immediately falls in love. We have seen how Snow White is an idealized image of what a woman was supposed to be, and here she assumes one of the “acceptable” roles a woman could hold, that of the wife. The archetype of the Damsel in Distress is present within the character of Snow White. We see the Prince as the Hero, saving Snow White, who’s rendered helpless until he kisses her. I believe that this entire scene shows her role of sexuality being condemned. As discussed before, the sexual symbol of the apple puts her in a sleeping death, which is only redeemed when the male comes and plays the active role. Despite the themes that this story seems to promote, placing full dependence on love or a man to save your life is simply not a healthy way to live.\n\nThe film *Pocahontas* introduces us to the fictitious romance between Powhatan Princess Pocahontas and English Explorer John Smith. Their love story offers a much more complex pairing versus Snow White and her nameless rent-a-prince. The gender roles of this love story, especially compared to Snow White seem to be counter-stereotypical. An interesting study done by Dawn England examined each movie and describes each instance of these Disney characters exhibiting stereotypical “masculine” and “feminine” gender roles. This study observed the masculine traits in characters, examples involve such stereotypical male traits in fairy tales ranging from brave to violent. Conversely the feminine traits taken into consideration in this study include things like docile or gentleness. According to England’s study, Pocahontas exhibits 105 “masculine” versus 130 “feminine,” this is much closer to equal than Snow White exhibiting only 13 instances of the masculine gender role, and 137 feminine (558). This is a stark contrast that statistically shows the difference between Snow White and Pocahontas' relation to gender roles, which heavily reflects upon their roles in their romances. A prime example of this reversal of gender roles is seen upon John Smith's near execution. As we see, it is Pocahontas who is throwing her body over John, willing to sacrifice her own life for his. This places Pocahontas in a position of power and dominance and John Smith in a role of helplessness, effectively eliminating that aspect of the damsel in distress motif. The woman is no longer needs to be saved but she is now the savior. Also unlike her poison apple eating predecessor, I have found that Pocahontas takes the notion that she “needs to be saved” as an insult. This is seen in an earlier scene when John Smith tells Pocahontas how he and his fellow Englishmen have “improved the lives of savages everywhere” to which she takes obvious insult. This negative reaction to needing to be saved is important to note in discussions of the “female needing rescue” motif. Another major difference in the love story of this film is in its ending. Upon John Smith needing to return to England he extends Pocahontas an invitation to join him but she declines.  While the film is ultimately based upon romance, Pocahontas is no damsel in distress, and places her priority on her family and her people rather than chasing romantic love, further painting her as a strong woman independent from men. Unlike Snow White, she does not assume the “acceptable” role as a man's wife. I believe all of these things go to show that romantic relations do not always have to act as a hindrance to female strength and that there is power of family over romance, both of which are further expanded upon in later films.\n\nTaking this evolution a step above Pocahontas, for the first time our heroine, Elsa, never has a love interest at all. In fact there is little to no mention of Elsa's romantic life in the film. Her story simply does not need to involve a man; her emotions, motives and aspirations are more than complex enough to tell a story. While a female's romantic relationships don’t have to be a threat to her characterization, it’s important to show a heroine whose story doesn’t have to involve such themes in the first place. This is an obvious intentional message to send, and is where Elsa comes in a step above Pocahontas. However, Elsa's relationship to other men concerning her role as a woman is still important to her story. I observe Elsa as a symbol of a threat to male power. Upon the revelation of her magic, she’s immediately demonized mostly by the men around her. It’s also important to note that this revelation takes place during Elsa's coronation as queen. She’s already literally displaying her political power as queen, to which certain characters look to exploit. Specifically the character of The Duke of Weaselton, thinking out loud upon entering the palace he says “Open those gates so I may unlock your secrets and exploit your riches!” This is why Elsa's powers are so frightening to him: he proclaims Elsa as a “monster” because she has a power, which he doesn’t understand and therefore cannot effectively control. She has the ability to do something that’s out of the control of men and that scares them. Their only chance is to try to tear her down by demonizing her magic. Historically, this theme is exemplified with many “Witch Hunts” throughout history, where, due to a fear of women gaining power, many girls would be falsely accused of evil magic. It’s not a coincidence that “evil” witches are stereotypically female. Elsa's overcoming of this patriarchal demonization of her supernatural and political power proves to be a dire aspect in the film. As we see, unlike Snow White, men can be, and often are, the very source of the main conflict rather than the solution.\n\nWhen observing a female character's independence from men it’s important to observe the nature of the relationships she forms with fellow women. Many female relationships too often fall to the sidelines, or into one category; competition. When fellow women are seen only as competition for male affection it severely hinders her independence. Just like Snow White's only female-to-female relationship with the Evil Queen. “Since physical appearance has traditionally been the most valuable asset for a woman, beauty makes her eligible for marriage, it should come as no surprise that anyone considered superior in beauty is an enemy that must be destroyed.” (González). We see this as an example in the Evil Queen's vice being born out of her envy of Snow White being “Fairest of them all”. As González indicates, this motive is a result of the importance society has--and still--places on female beauty and attractiveness. Expanding upon this idea, the Queen’s vanity and evilness play into one of only two categories most female characters fell into. Usually a female character was either the good “virgin” or the evil “whore.” González describes the Queen in relation to this “virgin-whore motif as, “The old, fallen woman, as the representation of the world of experience from which the heroine must be preserved, is introduced as a threat to the eternal state of innocence in which a woman is expected to remain” (204). It would seem that a woman who doesn’t remain in a state of innocence or male dependence is a menace. To expand on this idea, I observe the intention of these characterizations is for the audience to be conditioned to see Snow White’s innocence and dependence on a man as a positive aspects and, as discussed before, ideals for how women were supposed to act, while the Queen’s independence, power, and lack of a King is portrayed along with negativity, jealousy and evilness, how a woman was expected to oppose. This paints female independence as something that can only be seen in one who is threatening and harmful. This “Virgin versus Whore” motif proves to be overall problematic as it overly simplifies the portrayal of what a woman could be in film and society and demonizes females with power independent from men.\n\nWhile Snow White's only female-to-female exchange came in the form of a deadly competition with a jealous queen, we see Pocahontas forming positive and rewarding relationships with other females. Pocahontas's very first interaction within her film is with her female best friend, Nakoma. The nature of their relationship is not one of rivalry or competition for a man's affection, but rather of protection and mutual support. Upon learning of Pocahontas's relationship with a white settler, Nakoma's reaction does not include any jealousy or rivalry but rather she caringly and concerningly grabs her hand and says, “Pocahontas, please. You're my best friend. I don't want you to get hurt.” The caring nature of her best friend lends to the idea that females can and should protect and build each other up, rather than tear each other down in the name of a man.  I believe this relationship was written to further show that female characters only motives don’t have to involve male affection. However, we often see Pocahontas not listening to Nakoma's caring voice of reason, and we still see this relationship as secondary to the romance and too often falls to the sidelines in favor of her relationship with a man. The historical figure of Pocahontas offers many interesting stories and lessons yet the film and design of her character definitely gravitate towards her male relationships. While this female relationship is positively portrayed and rewarding, we don’t see female-to-female bonds as a focus of a film until 2013's Frozen.\n\nThe relationship Elsa has with her sister Anna is important because it is the main course of the film rather than a side dish. It shows the strength of the sisterly bond has in place of romantic bonds. One aspect of their relationship that comes into play when discussing the ideals of feminism within the film is their differing views of romance. Elsa responds to Anna’s engagement by saying, “What do you understand about true love? You can't marry a man you just met,” effectively crushing the dreams of the majority of her fellow Disney princesses. This viewpoint proves to be quite useful as the character whom Anna wished to marry, Hans, is revealed to be the true antagonist of the film. I believe this twist serves to show the fault of the “love at first sight” motif that is all too common in fairy tales. It’s not always a good idea to wed the first guy who sings a duet with you. Sure, in real life maybe he won't try to kill you and your sister and take your kingdom, but Elsa’s maturity and caring for her sister in this situation further paints her as a powerful and independent female role model. In fact, the “act of true love” comes from their sisterly bond, rather than a man. This aspect of their relationship is crucial. We see Anna sacrificing herself to save Elsa's life from the man she was almost ready to marry. However, not only does her act of sacrifice manage to save Elsa's life, it has in turn saved Anna's as her frozen heart begins to thaw. They have effectively saved each other's lives without the help of Prince Charming. The hero-damsel motif isn’t just reversed, it is dismantled in this example. We have seen *Snow White's* conflict a result of a female and her solution coming from a man saving the girl. In *Pocahontas* we then see the girl being the one to save the man. However with *Frozen* we see the problem stemming from men and a female-to-female bond being the ultimate solution. The film's entire main focus being on the power of strong female relationships and independence from men is an excellent example of the evolution from the days of poison apples.\n\n To expand on this traditionally negative connotation of female independence, I believe we see Elsa have more in common with the female villains of the past, such as the Evil Queen, rather than the supposed heroines: “Female independence has traditionally been perceived as a menace for the order established by patriarchal society, A woman who decides not to adapt herself to the traditional roles is seen as going against what nature has intended for her” (González 203).  If we are to draw a comparison between The Snow Queen of 2013 and The Evil Queen of 1937, it is easy to identify the evolution. They both hold absolute monarch political power without a king; They both practice some sort of supernatural magic; They are both powerful, independent and misunderstood and shunned by their community. However, the portrayal of Elsa as a protagonist rather than an antagonist is crucial. The Evil Queen is written as a purely evil villain, demonized by both the audience and producers, as González has mentioned. While Elsa is portrayed as heroic and misunderstood, feeling the negative effects of such attitudes held by the men in her world against female power and independence. An important comparison to draw upon is the use of the word “fool.” This word has become a favorite amongst villains such as Maleficent and the Evil Queen, often used to demean their henchmen or the protagonist. However Elsa uses it in a different way. “I'm such a fool, I can't be free” she sings. The only difference here is Elsa is directing the word at herself rather than others, tying her to the villain the men in the world lead her to believe she is. It shows a sort of internalized self-criticism taught to girls who dare to exhibit the independence, power, or differences traditionally portrayed by villains. Another aspect that is pivotal to their understanding is the intended reaction for these characters from their respective audiences. The audience of 1937’s *Snow White & The Seven Dwarfs* is lead to see the powerful and independent female as a threat, with negative intentions, wicked jealousy and disregard. However, the audience of 2013’s *Frozen* is lead to see this powerful and independent female as a misunderstood hero, one who takes control of her own destiny and sets a good example. Female independence doesn’t have to come from jealous and evil villains, but can and should be born out of heroines. One may argue that with the female villains, Disney has been portraying strong and independent females all along. However, I would argue that there is an underlying negative message in portraying these things in antagonists. It would seem as though it is saying that females exhibiting these strengths and powers are doomed to be defeated, and receive an unhappy ending. While powerless and weaker female characters are the ones that receive, or “deserve” a happy ending. When self-sufficiency, sexuality and strength in female characters is only shown in the evil villains it provides an overall negative connotation to an audience of impressionable young kids. This makes protagonists displaying these traits all the more important.\n\nMusic plays an important role, not only in the plot development, but also in offering a look into the messages of the films as well. Snow White sings the song “Someday My Prince Will Come.” The title itself lends to the passive dependence women were expected to take within romance and life that we have previously discussed. In the present day it is easy to see how this message doesn’t exactly work. Taken directly from the piece, “Wedding bells will ring, Someday when my dreams come true”. This presents the idea that a woman’s “dreams coming true” usually only involving “wedding bells ringing”. The way this idea is presented in the song is as if the only acceptable dream for women is being a wife dependent on males, which goes back to Snow White’s overall portrayal being based upon the strict standards and ideals society had for females.\n\nIn Pocahontas’ “Just Around the Riverbend,” “Pocahontas’ dissatisfaction subverts the conventions of previous Disney songs” (Zarranz 58). This song presents her dissatisfaction with another character, Kocoum's, marriage proposal. Pocahontas sings that she “ignores the sound of distant drumming” for a “handsome sturdy husband who builds handsome sturdy walls.” Along with this contrast, another interesting example of this subversion is in lyrics, from Snow White's “Dreams Coming True” when “Wedding Bells Ring,” to Pocahontas singing “Should I Marry Kocoum? Is All My Dreaming at an End?” This direct contrast not only paints a woman's dreams as something more than just finding a handsome, sturdy husband, but also showing that it could in fact signal the end of her dreams. So while Snow White exhibits the idealized and ultimately outdated and harmful concept that a woman's wedding is the pinnacle of her life, Pocahontas exhibits the opposite. This song rather paints marriage as something she is dreading, rather than dreaming of. The song also paints Pocahontas as a very active part of her love life. While Snow White may sit at the riverbank waiting for high tide to bring in whatever prince she sings a duet with first, Pocahontas jumps right in, listens to her heart and wants to make her own decisions in her romantic life.\n\nJust like discussed previously, Elsa's story and song “Let it Go” do not involve romantic love in the first place. While Snow White sings about a dream marriage proposal, and Pocahontas sings of a rejection of such concepts, Elsa's main number is about her own liberation and power. This takes the ideas of female independence and freedom a step above Pocahontas and a leap above Snow White. Many lines of the song lend to the ideas of female independence, power and even underlying tones of sexual liberation. From the first verse's “I couldn't keep it in, heaven knows I tried” to the second verse's “The fears that once controlled me, can't get to me at all” addresses the restrictions Elsa, and many females, have experienced through both historic and modern society's impossible standards for women. Elsa associates her power with fear and misunderstanding, but within this number we see not only acceptance, but celebration of being powerful. This also examines the danger of women living with such restrictions over their lives. Those restrictions only serve to create a sense of shame, fear and inequality from their male counterparts. “Let it Go” definitely ties us back to the ideas of sexual liberation through various undertones in the lyrics. The lyric that I believe sums up the entire idea of the song comes in the final chorus, “Let it go and I'll rise like the break of dawn, let it go That perfect girl is gone, here I stand in the light of day.” “That Perfect Girl is Gone” not only excellently sums up the message of this song and film, but of the entire idea that I’m researching. The strive for perfection and unrealistic standards of beauty, femininity and the roles women are “supposed” to play in society are harmful and effectively “let go.” While, Elsa shows us the harms when we try to abide by these outdated expectations of Snow White, she also exhibits the liberation experienced when they are let go and is free and liberated similar to Pocahontas and takes it a step further.\n\nWhile the strives the Disney studios have made in terms of their portrayals of female independence within their films has proven to be quite progressive, it’s important to note that even the most recent characters and films aren’t without issues in terms of gender relations and equality. While, as discussed, it’s healthy for female sexuality to be more freely expressed, there is a line to be drawn between portraying females that are confident with their sexuality and females designed simply for sex appeal. This isn’t to say that certain misguided decisions behind the scenes totally discredit the positive aspects of these characters. An interesting project that I have come across called the “RealPrincess” which I found to be an excellent example of putting pressure on Disney studios to expand even further with their feminist evolution. This project entailed girls drawing their version of “Real Princesses” which included princess who were either non-attractive, plus-sized, disabled, gay, transgender, and other aspects not yet explored by Disney. We’ve seen unattractive males as protagonists but all of the females have been relatively pretty. I would like to think conversations like this would encourage a mainstream and popular studio like Disney to display these people's different stories to their broad audience and would just hope that the audience would be receptive these different Princesses. However, if there is any criticism of this article, I would say that the strawman fallacy is utilized here by setting up these characters as easier to knock down. “One of the most nefarious aspects of the traditional Disney princess model is the stereotypical, hyper-feminine ideals their narratives promote” (Zellinger 3). The author seems to broadly generalize all of Disney's female protagonists by the older stereotype of helpless damsels in distress in order to further make their argument. I feel Pocahontas, Mulan and Elsa are important points of progression, although their role as relatively attractive females remain. It is important to keep a certain amount of pressure on our media to keep striving to improve the portrayals of females, however, it is also important to still offer praise and encouragement for improvements that we do see.\n\nThese three characters offer a glimpse into the overall evolution of female characters within Disney films. Putting them side by side we see how the portrayals of female liberation has gradually improved, results varying from a passive, naïve and virginal young girl to confident, strong willed and three-dimensional young women. It seems the further we venture into demonstrating complexity, independence and imperfections in females the closer we get to achieving the perfect female role model.\n\n### Works Cited\nEngland, D.

The princesses have littered young children’s bedrooms, theme parks and films for nearly a century and in turn have become a large topic of debate and observation. These conversations vary from praise to criticism; the focus has been on the ever-changing portrayal of female independence, strength and sexuality throughout the years. Snow White from the film <em>Snow White and the Seven Dwarves</em> represents a positive portrayal of female repression and restriction, while Pocahontas from the film <em>Pocahontas</em> represents a positive portrayal of female freedom. Elsa from the film <em>Frozen</em> acts as a bridge between these two, looking to exhibit the dangers of female restrictions such as Snow White and the celebration of female liberation and freedom such as Pocahontas, which paints her as a three-dimensional heroine exhibiting this progression. However I look to argue that, despite popular opinions and social media reactions to <em>Frozen</em>, Elsa is definitely not the first female heroine to exhibit independence, a healthy sexual expression or strength. I would like to show how there has been a gradual linear progression of these aspects all along that has increasingly improved over time, rather than overnight. I look to make this argument by examining the expression of female sexuality and independence and how it has progressed over time in different ways through three Disney heroines.</p>\n<p>Our three heroines can be seen as examples of how females presented different stages of independence and sexual expression in film. Nearly eighty years ago we were introduced to the beautiful and innocent, yet passive Snow White. Displaying the beauty ideals of a young female and the part which she plays in society in her film, Snow White can be looked at as an example of how females were expected to be behave. Flash forward nearly fifty-seven years and we’re introduced to an entirely different type of heroine; the Native American Pocahontas proves to show a different side of what a female character can possibly be. An independent, free-spirited daydreamer, Pocahontas plays a much more active role in her life and is portrayed as a liberated and powerful character. In an icy blast we find ourselves in present day where just less than two years ago we were introduced to the Snow Queen of Arendelle. We see this character go from the villain of the original tale to a complex anti-hero of the final film. Not only does Elsa offer us a celebration of an independent and powerful female character, but she also the shows downfall of restricting such strengths.</p>\n<p>When we are discussing the roles a female character plays in relation to the stereotypical gender roles and the portrayal of her independence the female’s expression of sexuality is a pivotal plot point. In family films like these we usually see sexuality as an underlying theme, being expressed through various symbols and subtle characterizations. The expression of female sexuality has gone through many different steps to get to where we are today. Snow White is presented as the idealized patriarchal figure of what women should emulate: Snow White is non-sexual, conservative, naïve, innocent and passive. Her character design includes a long dress, a modest neckline, and hair done-up tightly while her body language can be described as modest, restricted and proper. All of these physical traits can easily play into the ideal of how women “should” think and behave. An important symbol in the film for sexuality is the apple. With the allusion to the temptation of Eve in the Garden of Eden, Snow White’s apple symbolizes a sexual and deadly temptation, sending an underlying message of the “danger” of a female expressing her “sinful” sexuality. We see this apple offered by the only other female character. This further paints the image that all sin arises from the temptation of females (those who don’t emulate Snow White’s brand of innocence). Snow White effectively “dies” from even one taste of this “sin” only to be rescued by a man. I believe that this not only places Snow White in a helpless role, but also sends a message that sexuality is only appropriate or redeemable when it’s a male perpetrating the action.</p>\n<p>If we’re to compare Snow White to Pocahontas, it’s almost the complete opposite. Looking at character design we see Pocahontas as having a more curvy or sexualized image, with a short dress, an off-the-shoulder neckline, all completed with her hair down. Hair can act as a symbol for sexuality or expressive freedom. Specifically in that Snow White’s uptight, structured and modest hair style offers a glimpse into her conservative role concerning sexuality while Pocahontas’s raven hair frequently seen flowing in the wind can be looked at as more sexually liberated. Pocahontas also sports a tattoo, which would be hard to imagine on Snow White. Tattoos in literature are often symbols of individuality or freedom of expression. This sense of freedom is very important in her characterization. “Pocahontas has her mother’s spirit, she goes wherever the wind takes her” are the first words spoken of her. Her character is also frequently seen running and jumping throughout the film, a clear contrast from Snow White’s reserved body language. This introduction to her character paints her as a free-spirited woman living without the restrictions of characters like Snow White. However, the aspect of her more sexual image that is holding this character back from being fully progressive is arguably the fact that her sexual expression is still very much in relation to the entertainment of the male gaze. This is due to her story being based around her male relationships and the attention she receives from men. There’s a thin line between designing a sexually confident and expressive female character and designing a female character placing emphasis on “sex appeal.” I believe Pocahontas certainly walks this line which potentially hinders her progression and independence by still placing some of her sexual expression on the dependence on men.</p>\n<p>We observe the character Queen Elsa as she brings our ideas here full circle. I believe Elsa offers a middle ground between these two ideas. These are presented in the initial portrayal of her conservative and restricted nature similar to Snow White to her eventual liberation and freedom of Pocahontas. Elsa’s character design includes two different dresses. Her first, more conservative style includes an tightly done up hairstyle akin to Snow White. She sports a floor length dress, cape and symbolic gloves. Gloves in literature and films often symbolize the concealing of true motives, desires, sexuality or power. The gloves are ripped off both figuratively and literally during her transition to her next style. Her second dress is not just a pretty dress but offers a glimpse at symbolism for female sexuality. This style includes an icy blue dress with a slit in the leg, which hints at an openness towards female sexuality, and a long icy cape. During this transition we also see her undoing her hair in a dramatic fashion, figuratively and literally “letting her hair down,” similarly changing from Snow White’s up-do to Pocahontas’s freely flowing locks. In addition, we see many instances of body language playing into this symbolic embracing of female sexuality. During this change we see Elsa swinging her hips and freely throwing her arms up while “letting it go.” What I believe is most important here is that  this act of sexual liberation doesn’t have to be in position to entertain a man. Arguably, we couldn’t say this for Pocahontas whose story still very much places emphasis on men. Too often female sexuality, when it’s not condemned, is looked at as something that’s sole purpose is for the pleasing of men, as we see here that there was no John Smith or Prince Charming character for which she felt the need to impress. She never even has any sort of male love interest in the film at all, this symbolic sexual liberation takes place when she is completely by herself. This further shows Elsa’s sexual liberation coming from her accepting who she is and the powers she has. Female sexual liberation or expression can and should be born out of one’s own self-confidence and independence rather than being centered around male attention. It’s also important to observe the stages from shame to celebration through the portrayal of her initial conservative and fearful mindset to her eventual liberation and fearlessness. At the beginning we see many instances of the dangers of holding oneself back. She sings, “Be the good girl you always have to be, conceal, don’t feel, put on a show.” Many girls in society before and even today are commonly raised to sit down and be quiet and to not be open with one’s sexuality the ways boys are. We see through Elsa just how a woman can be negatively affected by being taught these things and “putting on a show.” I believe that her powers over ice and snow represent something more than just a magical aspect of the film. The way this magic is treated seems to symbolize female sexuality; it’s something beautiful and completely natural, but is shunned and shamed. Her parents forcing her to wear gloves to conceal her supernatural powers further shows this type of restriction she has been taught. So much so that when her true self is finally revealed, she reacts with fear and shame, showcasing the dangers of these strict standards and restrictions. However, her liberation and independence is celebrated, becoming a pivotal point in the film. The song “Let it Go” can be analyzed as having an underlying sexual liberation theme. The embracing of female freedom and sexuality and the rejection of strict regulations offer a much better and healthier message to audiences rather than the promotion of female conservativeness, innocence and non-sexuality. The repression of one’s sexuality due to societal expectations is shown in this film as a dangerous mindset. Her icy powers only caused her trouble when she had this mindset.</p>\n<p>Concerning sexuality and gender roles, the role that romance plays and the role of the men opposite these women offers an obvious relation. In the film <em>Snow White and the Seven Dwarves</em>, Snow White meets her love interest, a nameless prince, and immediately falls in love. We have seen how Snow White is an idealized image of what a woman was supposed to be, and here she assumes one of the “acceptable” roles a woman could hold, that of the wife. The archetype of the Damsel in Distress is present within the character of Snow White. We see the Prince as the Hero, saving Snow White, who’s rendered helpless until he kisses her. I believe that this entire scene shows her role of sexuality being condemned. As discussed before, the sexual symbol of the apple puts her in a sleeping death, which is only redeemed when the male comes and plays the active role. Despite the themes that this story seems to promote, placing full dependence on love or a man to save your life is simply not a healthy way to live.</p>\n<p>The film <em>Pocahontas</em> introduces us to the fictitious romance between Powhatan Princess Pocahontas and English Explorer John Smith. Their love story offers a much more complex pairing versus Snow White and her nameless rent-a-prince. The gender roles of this love story, especially compared to Snow White seem to be counter-stereotypical. An interesting study done by Dawn England examined each movie and describes each instance of these Disney characters exhibiting stereotypical “masculine” and “feminine” gender roles. This study observed the masculine traits in characters, examples involve such stereotypical male traits in fairy tales ranging from brave to violent. Conversely the feminine traits taken into consideration in this study include things like docile or gentleness. According to England’s study, Pocahontas exhibits 105 “masculine” versus 130 “feminine,” this is much closer to equal than Snow White exhibiting only 13 instances of the masculine gender role, and 137 feminine (558). This is a stark contrast that statistically shows the difference between Snow White and Pocahontas’ relation to gender roles, which heavily reflects upon their roles in their romances. A prime example of this reversal of gender roles is seen upon John Smith’s near execution. As we see, it is Pocahontas who is throwing her body over John, willing to sacrifice her own life for his. This places Pocahontas in a position of power and dominance and John Smith in a role of helplessness, effectively eliminating that aspect of the damsel in distress motif. The woman is no longer needs to be saved but she is now the savior. Also unlike her poison apple eating predecessor, I have found that Pocahontas takes the notion that she “needs to be saved” as an insult. This is seen in an earlier scene when John Smith tells Pocahontas how he and his fellow Englishmen have “improved the lives of savages everywhere” to which she takes obvious insult. This negative reaction to needing to be saved is important to note in discussions of the “female needing rescue” motif. Another major difference in the love story of this film is in its ending. Upon John Smith needing to return to England he extends Pocahontas an invitation to join him but she declines.  While the film is ultimately based upon romance, Pocahontas is no damsel in distress, and places her priority on her family and her people rather than chasing romantic love, further painting her as a strong woman independent from men. Unlike Snow White, she does not assume the “acceptable” role as a man’s wife. I believe all of these things go to show that romantic relations do not always have to act as a hindrance to female strength and that there is power of family over romance, both of which are further expanded upon in later films.</p>\n<p>Taking this evolution a step above Pocahontas, for the first time our heroine, Elsa, never has a love interest at all. In fact there is little to no mention of Elsa’s romantic life in the film. Her story simply does not need to involve a man; her emotions, motives and aspirations are more than complex enough to tell a story. While a female’s romantic relationships don’t have to be a threat to her characterization, it’s important to show a heroine whose story doesn’t have to involve such themes in the first place. This is an obvious intentional message to send, and is where Elsa comes in a step above Pocahontas. However, Elsa’s relationship to other men concerning her role as a woman is still important to her story. I observe Elsa as a symbol of a threat to male power. Upon the revelation of her magic, she’s immediately demonized mostly by the men around her. It’s also important to note that this revelation takes place during Elsa’s coronation as queen. She’s already literally displaying her political power as queen, to which certain characters look to exploit. Specifically the character of The Duke of Weaselton, thinking out loud upon entering the palace he says “Open those gates so I may unlock your secrets and exploit your riches!” This is why Elsa’s powers are so frightening to him: he proclaims Elsa as a “monster” because she has a power, which he doesn’t understand and therefore cannot effectively control. She has the ability to do something that’s out of the control of men and that scares them. Their only chance is to try to tear her down by demonizing her magic. Historically, this theme is exemplified with many “Witch Hunts” throughout history, where, due to a fear of women gaining power, many girls would be falsely accused of evil magic. It’s not a coincidence that “evil” witches are stereotypically female. Elsa’s overcoming of this patriarchal demonization of her supernatural and political power proves to be a dire aspect in the film. As we see, unlike Snow White, men can be, and often are, the very source of the main conflict rather than the solution.</p>\n<p>When observing a female character’s independence from men it’s important to observe the nature of the relationships she forms with fellow women. Many female relationships too often fall to the sidelines, or into one category; competition. When fellow women are seen only as competition for male affection it severely hinders her independence. Just like Snow White’s only female-to-female relationship with the Evil Queen. “Since physical appearance has traditionally been the most valuable asset for a woman, beauty makes her eligible for marriage, it should come as no surprise that anyone considered superior in beauty is an enemy that must be destroyed.” (González). We see this as an example in the Evil Queen’s vice being born out of her envy of Snow White being “Fairest of them all”. As González indicates, this motive is a result of the importance society has–and still–places on female beauty and attractiveness. Expanding upon this idea, the Queen’s vanity and evilness play into one of only two categories most female characters fell into. Usually a female character was either the good “virgin” or the evil “whore.” González describes the Queen in relation to this “virgin-whore motif as, “The old, fallen woman, as the representation of the world of experience from which the heroine must be preserved, is introduced as a threat to the eternal state of innocence in which a woman is expected to remain” (204). It would seem that a woman who doesn’t remain in a state of innocence or male dependence is a menace. To expand on this idea, I observe the intention of these characterizations is for the audience to be conditioned to see Snow White’s innocence and dependence on a man as a positive aspects and, as discussed before, ideals for how women were supposed to act, while the Queen’s independence, power, and lack of a King is portrayed along with negativity, jealousy and evilness, how a woman was expected to oppose. This paints female independence as something that can only be seen in one who is threatening and harmful. This “Virgin versus Whore” motif proves to be overall problematic as it overly simplifies the portrayal of what a woman could be in film and society and demonizes females with power independent from men.</p>\n<p>While Snow White’s only female-to-female exchange came in the form of a deadly competition with a jealous queen, we see Pocahontas forming positive and rewarding relationships with other females. Pocahontas’s very first interaction within her film is with her female best friend, Nakoma. The nature of their relationship is not one of rivalry or competition for a man’s affection, but rather of protection and mutual support. Upon learning of Pocahontas’s relationship with a white settler, Nakoma’s reaction does not include any jealousy or rivalry but rather she caringly and concerningly grabs her hand and says, “Pocahontas, please. You’re my best friend. I don’t want you to get hurt.” The caring nature of her best friend lends to the idea that females can and should protect and build each other up, rather than tear each other down in the name of a man.  I believe this relationship was written to further show that female characters only motives don’t have to involve male affection. However, we often see Pocahontas not listening to Nakoma’s caring voice of reason, and we still see this relationship as secondary to the romance and too often falls to the sidelines in favor of her relationship with a man. The historical figure of Pocahontas offers many interesting stories and lessons yet the film and design of her character definitely gravitate towards her male relationships. While this female relationship is positively portrayed and rewarding, we don’t see female-to-female bonds as a focus of a film until 2013’s Frozen.</p>\n<p>The relationship Elsa has with her sister Anna is important because it is the main course of the film rather than a side dish. It shows the strength of the sisterly bond has in place of romantic bonds. One aspect of their relationship that comes into play when discussing the ideals of feminism within the film is their differing views of romance. Elsa responds to Anna’s engagement by saying, “What do you understand about true love? You can’t marry a man you just met,” effectively crushing the dreams of the majority of her fellow Disney princesses. This viewpoint proves to be quite useful as the character whom Anna wished to marry, Hans, is revealed to be the true antagonist of the film. I believe this twist serves to show the fault of the “love at first sight” motif that is all too common in fairy tales. It’s not always a good idea to wed the first guy who sings a duet with you. Sure, in real life maybe he won’t try to kill you and your sister and take your kingdom, but Elsa’s maturity and caring for her sister in this situation further paints her as a powerful and independent female role model. In fact, the “act of true love” comes from their sisterly bond, rather than a man. This aspect of their relationship is crucial. We see Anna sacrificing herself to save Elsa’s life from the man she was almost ready to marry. However, not only does her act of sacrifice manage to save Elsa’s life, it has in turn saved Anna’s as her frozen heart begins to thaw. They have effectively saved each other’s lives without the help of Prince Charming. The hero-damsel motif isn’t just reversed, it is dismantled in this example. We have seen <em>Snow White’s</em> conflict a result of a female and her solution coming from a man saving the girl. In <em>Pocahontas</em> we then see the girl being the one to save the man. However with <em>Frozen</em> we see the problem stemming from men and a female-to-female bond being the ultimate solution. The film’s entire main focus being on the power of strong female relationships and independence from men is an excellent example of the evolution from the days of poison apples.</p>\n<p> To expand on this traditionally negative connotation of female independence, I believe we see Elsa have more in common with the female villains of the past, such as the Evil Queen, rather than the supposed heroines: “Female independence has traditionally been perceived as a menace for the order established by patriarchal society, A woman who decides not to adapt herself to the traditional roles is seen as going against what nature has intended for her” (González 203).  If we are to draw a comparison between The Snow Queen of 2013 and The Evil Queen of 1937, it is easy to identify the evolution. They both hold absolute monarch political power without a king; They both practice some sort of supernatural magic; They are both powerful, independent and misunderstood and shunned by their community. However, the portrayal of Elsa as a protagonist rather than an antagonist is crucial. The Evil Queen is written as a purely evil villain, demonized by both the audience and producers, as González has mentioned. While Elsa is portrayed as heroic and misunderstood, feeling the negative effects of such attitudes held by the men in her world against female power and independence. An important comparison to draw upon is the use of the word “fool.” This word has become a favorite amongst villains such as Maleficent and the Evil Queen, often used to demean their henchmen or the protagonist. However Elsa uses it in a different way. “I’m such a fool, I can’t be free” she sings. The only difference here is Elsa is directing the word at herself rather than others, tying her to the villain the men in the world lead her to believe she is. It shows a sort of internalized self-criticism taught to girls who dare to exhibit the independence, power, or differences traditionally portrayed by villains. Another aspect that is pivotal to their understanding is the intended reaction for these characters from their respective audiences. The audience of 1937’s <em>Snow White &amp; The Seven Dwarfs</em> is lead to see the powerful and independent female as a threat, with negative intentions, wicked jealousy and disregard. However, the audience of 2013’s <em>Frozen</em> is lead to see this powerful and independent female as a misunderstood hero, one who takes control of her own destiny and sets a good example. Female independence doesn’t have to come from jealous and evil villains, but can and should be born out of heroines. One may argue that with the female villains, Disney has been portraying strong and independent females all along. However, I would argue that there is an underlying negative message in portraying these things in antagonists. It would seem as though it is saying that females exhibiting these strengths and powers are doomed to be defeated, and receive an unhappy ending. While powerless and weaker female characters are the ones that receive, or “deserve” a happy ending. When self-sufficiency, sexuality and strength in female characters is only shown in the evil villains it provides an overall negative connotation to an audience of impressionable young kids. This makes protagonists displaying these traits all the more important.</p>\n<p>Music plays an important role, not only in the plot development, but also in offering a look into the messages of the films as well. Snow White sings the song “Someday My Prince Will Come.” The title itself lends to the passive dependence women were expected to take within romance and life that we have previously discussed. In the present day it is easy to see how this message doesn’t exactly work. Taken directly from the piece, “Wedding bells will ring, Someday when my dreams come true”. This presents the idea that a woman’s “dreams coming true” usually only involving “wedding bells ringing”. The way this idea is presented in the song is as if the only acceptable dream for women is being a wife dependent on males, which goes back to Snow White’s overall portrayal being based upon the strict standards and ideals society had for females.</p>\n<p>In Pocahontas’ “Just Around the Riverbend,” “Pocahontas’ dissatisfaction subverts the conventions of previous Disney songs” (Zarranz 58). This song presents her dissatisfaction with another character, Kocoum’s, marriage proposal. Pocahontas sings that she “ignores the sound of distant drumming” for a “handsome sturdy husband who builds handsome sturdy walls.” Along with this contrast, another interesting example of this subversion is in lyrics, from Snow White’s “Dreams Coming True” when “Wedding Bells Ring,” to Pocahontas singing “Should I Marry Kocoum? Is All My Dreaming at an End?” This direct contrast not only paints a woman’s dreams as something more than just finding a handsome, sturdy husband, but also showing that it could in fact signal the end of her dreams. So while Snow White exhibits the idealized and ultimately outdated and harmful concept that a woman’s wedding is the pinnacle of her life, Pocahontas exhibits the opposite. This song rather paints marriage as something she is dreading, rather than dreaming of. The song also paints Pocahontas as a very active part of her love life. While Snow White may sit at the riverbank waiting for high tide to bring in whatever prince she sings a duet with first, Pocahontas jumps right in, listens to her heart and wants to make her own decisions in her romantic life.</p>\n<p>Just like discussed previously, Elsa’s story and song “Let it Go” do not involve romantic love in the first place. While Snow White sings about a dream marriage proposal, and Pocahontas sings of a rejection of such concepts, Elsa’s main number is about her own liberation and power. This takes the ideas of female independence and freedom a step above Pocahontas and a leap above Snow White. Many lines of the song lend to the ideas of female independence, power and even underlying tones of sexual liberation. From the first verse’s “I couldn’t keep it in, heaven knows I tried” to the second verse’s “The fears that once controlled me, can’t get to me at all” addresses the restrictions Elsa, and many females, have experienced through both historic and modern society’s impossible standards for women. Elsa associates her power with fear and misunderstanding, but within this number we see not only acceptance, but celebration of being powerful. This also examines the danger of women living with such restrictions over their lives. Those restrictions only serve to create a sense of shame, fear and inequality from their male counterparts. “Let it Go” definitely ties us back to the ideas of sexual liberation through various undertones in the lyrics. The lyric that I believe sums up the entire idea of the song comes in the final chorus, “Let it go and I’ll rise like the break of dawn, let it go That perfect girl is gone, here I stand in the light of day.” “That Perfect Girl is Gone” not only excellently sums up the message of this song and film, but of the entire idea that I’m researching. The strive for perfection and unrealistic standards of beauty, femininity and the roles women are “supposed” to play in society are harmful and effectively “let go.” While, Elsa shows us the harms when we try to abide by these outdated expectations of Snow White, she also exhibits the liberation experienced when they are let go and is free and liberated similar to Pocahontas and takes it a step further.</p>\n<p>While the strives the Disney studios have made in terms of their portrayals of female independence within their films has proven to be quite progressive, it’s important to note that even the most recent characters and films aren’t without issues in terms of gender relations and equality. While, as discussed, it’s healthy for female sexuality to be more freely expressed, there is a line to be drawn between portraying females that are confident with their sexuality and females designed simply for sex appeal. This isn’t to say that certain misguided decisions behind the scenes totally discredit the positive aspects of these characters. An interesting project that I have come across called the “RealPrincess” which I found to be an excellent example of putting pressure on Disney studios to expand even further with their feminist evolution. This project entailed girls drawing their version of “Real Princesses” which included princess who were either non-attractive, plus-sized, disabled, gay, transgender, and other aspects not yet explored by Disney. We’ve seen unattractive males as protagonists but all of the females have been relatively pretty. I would like to think conversations like this would encourage a mainstream and popular studio like Disney to display these people’s different stories to their broad audience and would just hope that the audience would be receptive these different Princesses. However, if there is any criticism of this article, I would say that the strawman fallacy is utilized here by setting up these characters as easier to knock down. “One of the most nefarious aspects of the traditional Disney princess model is the stereotypical, hyper-feminine ideals their narratives promote” (Zellinger 3). The author seems to broadly generalize all of Disney’s female protagonists by the older stereotype of helpless damsels in distress in order to further make their argument. I feel Pocahontas, Mulan and Elsa are important points of progression, although their role as relatively attractive females remain. It is important to keep a certain amount of pressure on our media to keep striving to improve the portrayals of females, however, it is also important to still offer praise and encouragement for improvements that we do see.</p>\n<p>These three characters offer a glimpse into the overall evolution of female characters within Disney films. Putting them side by side we see how the portrayals of female liberation has gradually improved, results varying from a passive, naïve and virginal young girl to confident, strong willed and three-dimensional young women. It seems the further we venture into demonstrating complexity, independence and imperfections in females the closer we get to achieving the perfect female role model.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Works-Cited\"><a href=\"#Works-Cited\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Works Cited\"></a>Works Cited</h3><p>England, D.

The princesses have littered young children’s bedrooms, theme parks and films for nearly a century and in turn have become a large topic of debate and observation. These conversations vary from praise to criticism; the focus has been on the ever-changing portrayal of female independence, strength and sexuality throughout the years. Snow White from the film <em>Snow White and the Seven Dwarves</em> represents a positive portrayal of female repression and restriction, while Pocahontas from the film <em>Pocahontas</em> represents a positive portrayal of female freedom. Elsa from the film <em>Frozen</em> acts as a bridge between these two, looking to exhibit the dangers of female restrictions such as Snow White and the celebration of female liberation and freedom such as Pocahontas, which paints her as a three-dimensional heroine exhibiting this progression. However I look to argue that, despite popular opinions and social media reactions to <em>Frozen</em>, Elsa is definitely not the first female heroine to exhibit independence, a healthy sexual expression or strength. I would like to show how there has been a gradual linear progression of these aspects all along that has increasingly improved over time, rather than overnight. I look to make this argument by examining the expression of female sexuality and independence and how it has progressed over time in different ways through three Disney heroines.</p>\n<p>Our three heroines can be seen as examples of how females presented different stages of independence and sexual expression in film. Nearly eighty years ago we were introduced to the beautiful and innocent, yet passive Snow White. Displaying the beauty ideals of a young female and the part which she plays in society in her film, Snow White can be looked at as an example of how females were expected to be behave. Flash forward nearly fifty-seven years and we’re introduced to an entirely different type of heroine; the Native American Pocahontas proves to show a different side of what a female character can possibly be. An independent, free-spirited daydreamer, Pocahontas plays a much more active role in her life and is portrayed as a liberated and powerful character. In an icy blast we find ourselves in present day where just less than two years ago we were introduced to the Snow Queen of Arendelle. We see this character go from the villain of the original tale to a complex anti-hero of the final film. Not only does Elsa offer us a celebration of an independent and powerful female character, but she also the shows downfall of restricting such strengths.</p>\n<p>When we are discussing the roles a female character plays in relation to the stereotypical gender roles and the portrayal of her independence the female’s expression of sexuality is a pivotal plot point. In family films like these we usually see sexuality as an underlying theme, being expressed through various symbols and subtle characterizations. The expression of female sexuality has gone through many different steps to get to where we are today. Snow White is presented as the idealized patriarchal figure of what women should emulate: Snow White is non-sexual, conservative, naïve, innocent and passive. Her character design includes a long dress, a modest neckline, and hair done-up tightly while her body language can be described as modest, restricted and proper. All of these physical traits can easily play into the ideal of how women “should” think and behave. An important symbol in the film for sexuality is the apple. With the allusion to the temptation of Eve in the Garden of Eden, Snow White’s apple symbolizes a sexual and deadly temptation, sending an underlying message of the “danger” of a female expressing her “sinful” sexuality. We see this apple offered by the only other female character. This further paints the image that all sin arises from the temptation of females (those who don’t emulate Snow White’s brand of innocence). Snow White effectively “dies” from even one taste of this “sin” only to be rescued by a man. I believe that this not only places Snow White in a helpless role, but also sends a message that sexuality is only appropriate or redeemable when it’s a male perpetrating the action.</p>\n<p>If we’re to compare Snow White to Pocahontas, it’s almost the complete opposite. Looking at character design we see Pocahontas as having a more curvy or sexualized image, with a short dress, an off-the-shoulder neckline, all completed with her hair down. Hair can act as a symbol for sexuality or expressive freedom. Specifically in that Snow White’s uptight, structured and modest hair style offers a glimpse into her conservative role concerning sexuality while Pocahontas’s raven hair frequently seen flowing in the wind can be looked at as more sexually liberated. Pocahontas also sports a tattoo, which would be hard to imagine on Snow White. Tattoos in literature are often symbols of individuality or freedom of expression. This sense of freedom is very important in her characterization. “Pocahontas has her mother’s spirit, she goes wherever the wind takes her” are the first words spoken of her. Her character is also frequently seen running and jumping throughout the film, a clear contrast from Snow White’s reserved body language. This introduction to her character paints her as a free-spirited woman living without the restrictions of characters like Snow White. However, the aspect of her more sexual image that is holding this character back from being fully progressive is arguably the fact that her sexual expression is still very much in relation to the entertainment of the male gaze. This is due to her story being based around her male relationships and the attention she receives from men. There’s a thin line between designing a sexually confident and expressive female character and designing a female character placing emphasis on “sex appeal.” I believe Pocahontas certainly walks this line which potentially hinders her progression and independence by still placing some of her sexual expression on the dependence on men.</p>\n<p>We observe the character Queen Elsa as she brings our ideas here full circle. I believe Elsa offers a middle ground between these two ideas. These are presented in the initial portrayal of her conservative and restricted nature similar to Snow White to her eventual liberation and freedom of Pocahontas. Elsa’s character design includes two different dresses. Her first, more conservative style includes an tightly done up hairstyle akin to Snow White. She sports a floor length dress, cape and symbolic gloves. Gloves in literature and films often symbolize the concealing of true motives, desires, sexuality or power. The gloves are ripped off both figuratively and literally during her transition to her next style. Her second dress is not just a pretty dress but offers a glimpse at symbolism for female sexuality. This style includes an icy blue dress with a slit in the leg, which hints at an openness towards female sexuality, and a long icy cape. During this transition we also see her undoing her hair in a dramatic fashion, figuratively and literally “letting her hair down,” similarly changing from Snow White’s up-do to Pocahontas’s freely flowing locks. In addition, we see many instances of body language playing into this symbolic embracing of female sexuality. During this change we see Elsa swinging her hips and freely throwing her arms up while “letting it go.” What I believe is most important here is that  this act of sexual liberation doesn’t have to be in position to entertain a man. Arguably, we couldn’t say this for Pocahontas whose story still very much places emphasis on men. Too often female sexuality, when it’s not condemned, is looked at as something that’s sole purpose is for the pleasing of men, as we see here that there was no John Smith or Prince Charming character for which she felt the need to impress. She never even has any sort of male love interest in the film at all, this symbolic sexual liberation takes place when she is completely by herself. This further shows Elsa’s sexual liberation coming from her accepting who she is and the powers she has. Female sexual liberation or expression can and should be born out of one’s own self-confidence and independence rather than being centered around male attention. It’s also important to observe the stages from shame to celebration through the portrayal of her initial conservative and fearful mindset to her eventual liberation and fearlessness. At the beginning we see many instances of the dangers of holding oneself back. She sings, “Be the good girl you always have to be, conceal, don’t feel, put on a show.” Many girls in society before and even today are commonly raised to sit down and be quiet and to not be open with one’s sexuality the ways boys are. We see through Elsa just how a woman can be negatively affected by being taught these things and “putting on a show.” I believe that her powers over ice and snow represent something more than just a magical aspect of the film. The way this magic is treated seems to symbolize female sexuality; it’s something beautiful and completely natural, but is shunned and shamed. Her parents forcing her to wear gloves to conceal her supernatural powers further shows this type of restriction she has been taught. So much so that when her true self is finally revealed, she reacts with fear and shame, showcasing the dangers of these strict standards and restrictions. However, her liberation and independence is celebrated, becoming a pivotal point in the film. The song “Let it Go” can be analyzed as having an underlying sexual liberation theme. The embracing of female freedom and sexuality and the rejection of strict regulations offer a much better and healthier message to audiences rather than the promotion of female conservativeness, innocence and non-sexuality. The repression of one’s sexuality due to societal expectations is shown in this film as a dangerous mindset. Her icy powers only caused her trouble when she had this mindset.</p>\n<p>Concerning sexuality and gender roles, the role that romance plays and the role of the men opposite these women offers an obvious relation. In the film <em>Snow White and the Seven Dwarves</em>, Snow White meets her love interest, a nameless prince, and immediately falls in love. We have seen how Snow White is an idealized image of what a woman was supposed to be, and here she assumes one of the “acceptable” roles a woman could hold, that of the wife. The archetype of the Damsel in Distress is present within the character of Snow White. We see the Prince as the Hero, saving Snow White, who’s rendered helpless until he kisses her. I believe that this entire scene shows her role of sexuality being condemned. As discussed before, the sexual symbol of the apple puts her in a sleeping death, which is only redeemed when the male comes and plays the active role. Despite the themes that this story seems to promote, placing full dependence on love or a man to save your life is simply not a healthy way to live.</p>\n<p>The film <em>Pocahontas</em> introduces us to the fictitious romance between Powhatan Princess Pocahontas and English Explorer John Smith. Their love story offers a much more complex pairing versus Snow White and her nameless rent-a-prince. The gender roles of this love story, especially compared to Snow White seem to be counter-stereotypical. An interesting study done by Dawn England examined each movie and describes each instance of these Disney characters exhibiting stereotypical “masculine” and “feminine” gender roles. This study observed the masculine traits in characters, examples involve such stereotypical male traits in fairy tales ranging from brave to violent. Conversely the feminine traits taken into consideration in this study include things like docile or gentleness. According to England’s study, Pocahontas exhibits 105 “masculine” versus 130 “feminine,” this is much closer to equal than Snow White exhibiting only 13 instances of the masculine gender role, and 137 feminine (558). This is a stark contrast that statistically shows the difference between Snow White and Pocahontas’ relation to gender roles, which heavily reflects upon their roles in their romances. A prime example of this reversal of gender roles is seen upon John Smith’s near execution. As we see, it is Pocahontas who is throwing her body over John, willing to sacrifice her own life for his. This places Pocahontas in a position of power and dominance and John Smith in a role of helplessness, effectively eliminating that aspect of the damsel in distress motif. The woman is no longer needs to be saved but she is now the savior. Also unlike her poison apple eating predecessor, I have found that Pocahontas takes the notion that she “needs to be saved” as an insult. This is seen in an earlier scene when John Smith tells Pocahontas how he and his fellow Englishmen have “improved the lives of savages everywhere” to which she takes obvious insult. This negative reaction to needing to be saved is important to note in discussions of the “female needing rescue” motif. Another major difference in the love story of this film is in its ending. Upon John Smith needing to return to England he extends Pocahontas an invitation to join him but she declines.  While the film is ultimately based upon romance, Pocahontas is no damsel in distress, and places her priority on her family and her people rather than chasing romantic love, further painting her as a strong woman independent from men. Unlike Snow White, she does not assume the “acceptable” role as a man’s wife. I believe all of these things go to show that romantic relations do not always have to act as a hindrance to female strength and that there is power of family over romance, both of which are further expanded upon in later films.</p>\n<p>Taking this evolution a step above Pocahontas, for the first time our heroine, Elsa, never has a love interest at all. In fact there is little to no mention of Elsa’s romantic life in the film. Her story simply does not need to involve a man; her emotions, motives and aspirations are more than complex enough to tell a story. While a female’s romantic relationships don’t have to be a threat to her characterization, it’s important to show a heroine whose story doesn’t have to involve such themes in the first place. This is an obvious intentional message to send, and is where Elsa comes in a step above Pocahontas. However, Elsa’s relationship to other men concerning her role as a woman is still important to her story. I observe Elsa as a symbol of a threat to male power. Upon the revelation of her magic, she’s immediately demonized mostly by the men around her. It’s also important to note that this revelation takes place during Elsa’s coronation as queen. She’s already literally displaying her political power as queen, to which certain characters look to exploit. Specifically the character of The Duke of Weaselton, thinking out loud upon entering the palace he says “Open those gates so I may unlock your secrets and exploit your riches!” This is why Elsa’s powers are so frightening to him: he proclaims Elsa as a “monster” because she has a power, which he doesn’t understand and therefore cannot effectively control. She has the ability to do something that’s out of the control of men and that scares them. Their only chance is to try to tear her down by demonizing her magic. Historically, this theme is exemplified with many “Witch Hunts” throughout history, where, due to a fear of women gaining power, many girls would be falsely accused of evil magic. It’s not a coincidence that “evil” witches are stereotypically female. Elsa’s overcoming of this patriarchal demonization of her supernatural and political power proves to be a dire aspect in the film. As we see, unlike Snow White, men can be, and often are, the very source of the main conflict rather than the solution.</p>\n<p>When observing a female character’s independence from men it’s important to observe the nature of the relationships she forms with fellow women. Many female relationships too often fall to the sidelines, or into one category; competition. When fellow women are seen only as competition for male affection it severely hinders her independence. Just like Snow White’s only female-to-female relationship with the Evil Queen. “Since physical appearance has traditionally been the most valuable asset for a woman, beauty makes her eligible for marriage, it should come as no surprise that anyone considered superior in beauty is an enemy that must be destroyed.” (González). We see this as an example in the Evil Queen’s vice being born out of her envy of Snow White being “Fairest of them all”. As González indicates, this motive is a result of the importance society has–and still–places on female beauty and attractiveness. Expanding upon this idea, the Queen’s vanity and evilness play into one of only two categories most female characters fell into. Usually a female character was either the good “virgin” or the evil “whore.” González describes the Queen in relation to this “virgin-whore motif as, “The old, fallen woman, as the representation of the world of experience from which the heroine must be preserved, is introduced as a threat to the eternal state of innocence in which a woman is expected to remain” (204). It would seem that a woman who doesn’t remain in a state of innocence or male dependence is a menace. To expand on this idea, I observe the intention of these characterizations is for the audience to be conditioned to see Snow White’s innocence and dependence on a man as a positive aspects and, as discussed before, ideals for how women were supposed to act, while the Queen’s independence, power, and lack of a King is portrayed along with negativity, jealousy and evilness, how a woman was expected to oppose. This paints female independence as something that can only be seen in one who is threatening and harmful. This “Virgin versus Whore” motif proves to be overall problematic as it overly simplifies the portrayal of what a woman could be in film and society and demonizes females with power independent from men.</p>\n<p>While Snow White’s only female-to-female exchange came in the form of a deadly competition with a jealous queen, we see Pocahontas forming positive and rewarding relationships with other females. Pocahontas’s very first interaction within her film is with her female best friend, Nakoma. The nature of their relationship is not one of rivalry or competition for a man’s affection, but rather of protection and mutual support. Upon learning of Pocahontas’s relationship with a white settler, Nakoma’s reaction does not include any jealousy or rivalry but rather she caringly and concerningly grabs her hand and says, “Pocahontas, please. You’re my best friend. I don’t want you to get hurt.” The caring nature of her best friend lends to the idea that females can and should protect and build each other up, rather than tear each other down in the name of a man.  I believe this relationship was written to further show that female characters only motives don’t have to involve male affection. However, we often see Pocahontas not listening to Nakoma’s caring voice of reason, and we still see this relationship as secondary to the romance and too often falls to the sidelines in favor of her relationship with a man. The historical figure of Pocahontas offers many interesting stories and lessons yet the film and design of her character definitely gravitate towards her male relationships. While this female relationship is positively portrayed and rewarding, we don’t see female-to-female bonds as a focus of a film until 2013’s Frozen.</p>\n<p>The relationship Elsa has with her sister Anna is important because it is the main course of the film rather than a side dish. It shows the strength of the sisterly bond has in place of romantic bonds. One aspect of their relationship that comes into play when discussing the ideals of feminism within the film is their differing views of romance. Elsa responds to Anna’s engagement by saying, “What do you understand about true love? You can’t marry a man you just met,” effectively crushing the dreams of the majority of her fellow Disney princesses. This viewpoint proves to be quite useful as the character whom Anna wished to marry, Hans, is revealed to be the true antagonist of the film. I believe this twist serves to show the fault of the “love at first sight” motif that is all too common in fairy tales. It’s not always a good idea to wed the first guy who sings a duet with you. Sure, in real life maybe he won’t try to kill you and your sister and take your kingdom, but Elsa’s maturity and caring for her sister in this situation further paints her as a powerful and independent female role model. In fact, the “act of true love” comes from their sisterly bond, rather than a man. This aspect of their relationship is crucial. We see Anna sacrificing herself to save Elsa’s life from the man she was almost ready to marry. However, not only does her act of sacrifice manage to save Elsa’s life, it has in turn saved Anna’s as her frozen heart begins to thaw. They have effectively saved each other’s lives without the help of Prince Charming. The hero-damsel motif isn’t just reversed, it is dismantled in this example. We have seen <em>Snow White’s</em> conflict a result of a female and her solution coming from a man saving the girl. In <em>Pocahontas</em> we then see the girl being the one to save the man. However with <em>Frozen</em> we see the problem stemming from men and a female-to-female bond being the ultimate solution. The film’s entire main focus being on the power of strong female relationships and independence from men is an excellent example of the evolution from the days of poison apples.</p>\n<p> To expand on this traditionally negative connotation of female independence, I believe we see Elsa have more in common with the female villains of the past, such as the Evil Queen, rather than the supposed heroines: “Female independence has traditionally been perceived as a menace for the order established by patriarchal society, A woman who decides not to adapt herself to the traditional roles is seen as going against what nature has intended for her” (González 203).  If we are to draw a comparison between The Snow Queen of 2013 and The Evil Queen of 1937, it is easy to identify the evolution. They both hold absolute monarch political power without a king; They both practice some sort of supernatural magic; They are both powerful, independent and misunderstood and shunned by their community. However, the portrayal of Elsa as a protagonist rather than an antagonist is crucial. The Evil Queen is written as a purely evil villain, demonized by both the audience and producers, as González has mentioned. While Elsa is portrayed as heroic and misunderstood, feeling the negative effects of such attitudes held by the men in her world against female power and independence. An important comparison to draw upon is the use of the word “fool.” This word has become a favorite amongst villains such as Maleficent and the Evil Queen, often used to demean their henchmen or the protagonist. However Elsa uses it in a different way. “I’m such a fool, I can’t be free” she sings. The only difference here is Elsa is directing the word at herself rather than others, tying her to the villain the men in the world lead her to believe she is. It shows a sort of internalized self-criticism taught to girls who dare to exhibit the independence, power, or differences traditionally portrayed by villains. Another aspect that is pivotal to their understanding is the intended reaction for these characters from their respective audiences. The audience of 1937’s <em>Snow White &amp; The Seven Dwarfs</em> is lead to see the powerful and independent female as a threat, with negative intentions, wicked jealousy and disregard. However, the audience of 2013’s <em>Frozen</em> is lead to see this powerful and independent female as a misunderstood hero, one who takes control of her own destiny and sets a good example. Female independence doesn’t have to come from jealous and evil villains, but can and should be born out of heroines. One may argue that with the female villains, Disney has been portraying strong and independent females all along. However, I would argue that there is an underlying negative message in portraying these things in antagonists. It would seem as though it is saying that females exhibiting these strengths and powers are doomed to be defeated, and receive an unhappy ending. While powerless and weaker female characters are the ones that receive, or “deserve” a happy ending. When self-sufficiency, sexuality and strength in female characters is only shown in the evil villains it provides an overall negative connotation to an audience of impressionable young kids. This makes protagonists displaying these traits all the more important.</p>\n<p>Music plays an important role, not only in the plot development, but also in offering a look into the messages of the films as well. Snow White sings the song “Someday My Prince Will Come.” The title itself lends to the passive dependence women were expected to take within romance and life that we have previously discussed. In the present day it is easy to see how this message doesn’t exactly work. Taken directly from the piece, “Wedding bells will ring, Someday when my dreams come true”. This presents the idea that a woman’s “dreams coming true” usually only involving “wedding bells ringing”. The way this idea is presented in the song is as if the only acceptable dream for women is being a wife dependent on males, which goes back to Snow White’s overall portrayal being based upon the strict standards and ideals society had for females.</p>\n<p>In Pocahontas’ “Just Around the Riverbend,” “Pocahontas’ dissatisfaction subverts the conventions of previous Disney songs” (Zarranz 58). This song presents her dissatisfaction with another character, Kocoum’s, marriage proposal. Pocahontas sings that she “ignores the sound of distant drumming” for a “handsome sturdy husband who builds handsome sturdy walls.” Along with this contrast, another interesting example of this subversion is in lyrics, from Snow White’s “Dreams Coming True” when “Wedding Bells Ring,” to Pocahontas singing “Should I Marry Kocoum? Is All My Dreaming at an End?” This direct contrast not only paints a woman’s dreams as something more than just finding a handsome, sturdy husband, but also showing that it could in fact signal the end of her dreams. So while Snow White exhibits the idealized and ultimately outdated and harmful concept that a woman’s wedding is the pinnacle of her life, Pocahontas exhibits the opposite. This song rather paints marriage as something she is dreading, rather than dreaming of. The song also paints Pocahontas as a very active part of her love life. While Snow White may sit at the riverbank waiting for high tide to bring in whatever prince she sings a duet with first, Pocahontas jumps right in, listens to her heart and wants to make her own decisions in her romantic life.</p>\n<p>Just like discussed previously, Elsa’s story and song “Let it Go” do not involve romantic love in the first place. While Snow White sings about a dream marriage proposal, and Pocahontas sings of a rejection of such concepts, Elsa’s main number is about her own liberation and power. This takes the ideas of female independence and freedom a step above Pocahontas and a leap above Snow White. Many lines of the song lend to the ideas of female independence, power and even underlying tones of sexual liberation. From the first verse’s “I couldn’t keep it in, heaven knows I tried” to the second verse’s “The fears that once controlled me, can’t get to me at all” addresses the restrictions Elsa, and many females, have experienced through both historic and modern society’s impossible standards for women. Elsa associates her power with fear and misunderstanding, but within this number we see not only acceptance, but celebration of being powerful. This also examines the danger of women living with such restrictions over their lives. Those restrictions only serve to create a sense of shame, fear and inequality from their male counterparts. “Let it Go” definitely ties us back to the ideas of sexual liberation through various undertones in the lyrics. The lyric that I believe sums up the entire idea of the song comes in the final chorus, “Let it go and I’ll rise like the break of dawn, let it go That perfect girl is gone, here I stand in the light of day.” “That Perfect Girl is Gone” not only excellently sums up the message of this song and film, but of the entire idea that I’m researching. The strive for perfection and unrealistic standards of beauty, femininity and the roles women are “supposed” to play in society are harmful and effectively “let go.” While, Elsa shows us the harms when we try to abide by these outdated expectations of Snow White, she also exhibits the liberation experienced when they are let go and is free and liberated similar to Pocahontas and takes it a step further.</p>\n<p>While the strives the Disney studios have made in terms of their portrayals of female independence within their films has proven to be quite progressive, it’s important to note that even the most recent characters and films aren’t without issues in terms of gender relations and equality. While, as discussed, it’s healthy for female sexuality to be more freely expressed, there is a line to be drawn between portraying females that are confident with their sexuality and females designed simply for sex appeal. This isn’t to say that certain misguided decisions behind the scenes totally discredit the positive aspects of these characters. An interesting project that I have come across called the “RealPrincess” which I found to be an excellent example of putting pressure on Disney studios to expand even further with their feminist evolution. This project entailed girls drawing their version of “Real Princesses” which included princess who were either non-attractive, plus-sized, disabled, gay, transgender, and other aspects not yet explored by Disney. We’ve seen unattractive males as protagonists but all of the females have been relatively pretty. I would like to think conversations like this would encourage a mainstream and popular studio like Disney to display these people’s different stories to their broad audience and would just hope that the audience would be receptive these different Princesses. However, if there is any criticism of this article, I would say that the strawman fallacy is utilized here by setting up these characters as easier to knock down. “One of the most nefarious aspects of the traditional Disney princess model is the stereotypical, hyper-feminine ideals their narratives promote” (Zellinger 3). The author seems to broadly generalize all of Disney’s female protagonists by the older stereotype of helpless damsels in distress in order to further make their argument. I feel Pocahontas, Mulan and Elsa are important points of progression, although their role as relatively attractive females remain. It is important to keep a certain amount of pressure on our media to keep striving to improve the portrayals of females, however, it is also important to still offer praise and encouragement for improvements that we do see.</p>\n<p>These three characters offer a glimpse into the overall evolution of female characters within Disney films. Putting them side by side we see how the portrayals of female liberation has gradually improved, results varying from a passive, naïve and virginal young girl to confident, strong willed and three-dimensional young women. It seems the further we venture into demonstrating complexity, independence and imperfections in females the closer we get to achieving the perfect female role model.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Works-Cited\"><a href=\"#Works-Cited\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Works Cited\"></a>Works Cited</h3><p>England, D.
